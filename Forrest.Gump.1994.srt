00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:19,200
Hello.

2
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,829
My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.

3
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:30,420
Do you want a chocolate?

4
00:03:33,006 --> 00:03:36,426
I could eat about
a million and a half of these.

5
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:42,807
My mama always said
life was like a box of chocolates.

6
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:47,687
You never know what you're gonna get.

7
00:03:54,903 --> 00:03:57,447
Those must be comfortable shoes.

8
00:03:58,823 --> 00:04:03,494
I'll bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that and not feel a thing.

9
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:08,166
I wish I had shoes like that.

10
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,376
My feet hurt.

11
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:13,254
Mama always said there's an awful lot

12
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:16,549
you could tell about a person
by their shoes:

13
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:20,637
where they're going,
where they've been.

14
00:04:27,894 --> 00:04:29,938
I've worn lots of shoes.

15
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:37,862
I bet if I think about it real hard,
I could remember my first pair of shoes.

16
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:43,409
Mama said they'd take me anywhere.

17
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:46,829
<i>She said they was my magic shoes.</i>

18
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:50,083
All right, Forrest,
you can open your eyes now.

19
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:59,842
Let's take a little walk around.

20
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:08,434
How do those feel?

21
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:13,564
His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump,

22
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:16,150
as strong as I've ever seen,

23
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:19,612
but his back is as crooked
as a politician.

24
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:23,992
But we're gonna straighten him right up,
now, aren't we, Forrest?

25
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:25,201
Forrest!

26
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:27,912
<i>Now, when I was a baby,</i>

27
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:30,832
<i>Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero,</i>

28
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:33,334
<i>General Nathan Bedford Forrest.</i>

29
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:35,628
<i>She said we was related to him
in some way.</i>

30
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:37,088
<i>And what he did was,</i>

31
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:41,426
<i>he started up this club called
the Ku Klux Klan.</i>

32
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:44,846
<i>They'd all dress up in their robes
and their bed sheets</i>

33
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:49,267
<i>and act like a bunch of ghosts
or spooks or something.</i>

34
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:53,229
<i>They'd even put bed sheets
on their horses and ride around.</i>

35
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:56,357
<i>And anyway, that's how I got my name,</i>

36
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:57,859
<i>Forrest Gump.</i>

37
00:05:57,942 --> 00:05:59,694
<i>Mama said that the "Forrest" part</i>

38
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:03,322
<i>was to remind me that sometimes
we all do things that,</i>

39
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:06,200
<i>well, just don't make no sense.</i>

40
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:15,376
Okay... Get it, get it...

41
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,421
Wait, is it this way? Hold on.

42
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,840
All right...

43
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:23,092
What are you all staring at?

44
00:06:23,176 --> 00:06:27,638
Haven't you ever seen a little boy
with braces on his legs before?

45
00:06:29,182 --> 00:06:32,894
Don't ever let anybody tell you
they're better than you, Forrest.

46
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:35,563
If God intended
everybody to be the same,

47
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:37,774
he'd have given us all braces
on our legs.

48
00:06:37,857 --> 00:06:39,567
<i>Mama always had a way of
explaining things</i>

49
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,652
<i>so I could understand them.</i>

50
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:46,616
<i>We lived about a quarter mile
off Route 17,</i>

51
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:49,744
<i>about a half mile from
the town of Greenbow, Alabama.</i>

52
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:52,580
<i>That's in the county of Greenbow.</i>

53
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:57,085
<i>Our house had been in Mama's family
since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa</i>

54
00:06:57,168 --> 00:06:59,087
<i>had come across the ocean
about 1,000 years ago,</i>

55
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,089
<i>something like that.</i>

56
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:03,883
<i>Since it was just me and Mama
and we had all these empty rooms,</i>

57
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:06,719
<i>Mama decided to let those rooms out,</i>

58
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:08,763
<i>mostly to people passing through,</i>

59
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:12,809
<i>like from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.</i>

60
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:15,603
<i>That's how me and Mama got money.</i>

61
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:18,439
<i>Mama was a real smart lady.</i>

62
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:23,528
Remember what I told you, Forrest.
You're no different than anybody else is.

63
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,407
Did you hear what I said, Forrest?

64
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:32,662
You're the same as everybody else.
You are no different.

65
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:37,625
Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump.

66
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,919
Now, his IQ is 75.

67
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:43,840
Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock.

68
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,470
<i>She wanted me to have
the finest education,</i>

69
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:53,474
<i>so she took me to
the Greenbow County Central School.</i>

70
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:55,810
<i>I met the principal and all.</i>

71
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,188
I want to show you something,
Mrs. Gump.

72
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:02,525
Now, this is normal.

73
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:06,320
Forrest is right here.

74
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:12,702
The state requires a minimum IQ of
80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump.

75
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:16,080
He's gonna have to go
to a special school.

76
00:08:16,164 --> 00:08:18,291
Now, he'll be just fine.

77
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,169
What does "normal" mean, anyway?

78
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:24,630
He might be a bit on the slow side,

79
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,508
but my boy Forrest is gonna get

80
00:08:27,592 --> 00:08:30,136
the same opportunities
as everyone else.

81
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:34,015
He's not going to some special school
to learn how to re-tread tires.

82
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:37,268
We're talking about
five little points here.

83
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:41,606
There must be something can be done.

84
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:45,651
We're a progressive school system.

85
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:49,405
We don't want to see anybody
left behind.

86
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:53,743
Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

87
00:08:56,996 --> 00:08:58,873
He's on vacation.

88
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:20,144
Well, your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son.

89
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,110
You don't say much, do you?

90
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:41,582
"Finally, he had to try.

91
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,626
"It looked easy, but,

92
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,171
"oh, what happened.

93
00:09:47,255 --> 00:09:50,258
- "First, there..."
- Mama, what's "vacation" mean?

94
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,386
- Vacation?
- Where Daddy went.

95
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,724
Vacation's when you go somewhere

96
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:03,437
and you don't ever come back.

97
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:11,570
<i>Anyway, I guess you could
say me and Mama was on our own.</i>

98
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,409
<i>But we didn't mind.
Our house was never empty.</i>

99
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:19,078
<i>There was always folks
coming and going.</i>

100
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:20,246
Supper.

101
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:23,749
- It's supper, everyone. Forrest...
- My, my. That sure looks special.

102
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,377
<i>Sometimes we had
so many people staying with us</i>

103
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,130
<i>that every room
was filled with travelers.</i>

104
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:32,842
<i>You know, folks living out
of their suitcases</i>

105
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:35,886
<i>and hat cases and sample cases.</i>

106
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,390
Forrest Gump, it's suppertime! Forrest...

107
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,018
<i>One time, a young man
was staying with us,</i>

108
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:45,730
<i>and he had him a guitar case.</i>

109
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:03,706
Forrest! I told you not to bother
this nice young man.

110
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:05,124
Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am.

111
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:08,044
I was just showing him a thing or two
on the guitar here.

112
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:11,088
All right, but your supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.

113
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:14,133
Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.

114
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,387
Say, man, show me that crazy
little walk you just did there.

115
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:20,348
Slow it down some.

116
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:24,393
<i>I liked that guitar.</i>

117
00:11:25,061 --> 00:11:26,812
<i>It sounded good.</i>

118
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:32,777
<i>I started moving around to the music,</i>

119
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,695
<i>swinging my hips.</i>

120
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:39,825
<i>This one night,
me and Mama was out shopping,</i>

121
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:42,912
<i>and we walked right by
Benson's furniture and appliance store,</i>

122
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:44,580
<i>and guess what?</i>

123
00:11:56,926 --> 00:11:59,762
This is not for children's eyes.

124
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:04,100
<i>Some years later,
that handsome young man</i>

125
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:06,727
<i>who they called "The King,"</i>

126
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:09,146
<i>well, he'd sung too many songs,</i>

127
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:12,358
<i>had himself a heart attack,
or something.</i>

128
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,611
Must be hard being a king.

129
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:22,743
You know, it's funny how you remember
some things, but some things you can't.

130
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:27,373
- You do your very best now, Forrest.
- I sure will, Mama.

131
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:33,671
<i>I remember the bus ride
on the first day of school very well.</i>

132
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:38,926
Are you coming along?

133
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:42,513
Mama said not to be taking
rides from strangers.

134
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,765
This is the bus to school.

135
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,979
I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

136
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:54,942
- I'm Dorothy Harris.
- Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.

137
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,748
This seat's taken.

138
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:13,711
It's taken!

139
00:13:21,594 --> 00:13:23,471
You can't sit here.

140
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:29,059
<i>You know, it's funny what
a young man recollects,</i>

141
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:31,520
<i>'cause I don't remember being born.</i>

142
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:35,316
I don't recall what I got
for my first Christmas,

143
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,486
and I don't know when I went
on my first outdoor picnic.

144
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:43,282
But I do remember the first time I heard

145
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:46,202
the sweetest voice in the wide world.

146
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:49,079
You can sit here if you want.

147
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,878
<i>I had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.</i>

148
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,672
<i>She was like an angel.</i>

149
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:01,675
Well, are you gonna sit down,
or aren't you?

150
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,432
What's wrong with your legs?

151
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:12,770
Nothing at all, thank you.
My legs are just fine and dandy.

152
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,856
<i>I just sat next to her on that bus</i>

153
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,025
<i>and had a conversation
all the way to school.</i>

154
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,819
...my back's crooked like
a question mark.

155
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:22,071
These are going to make me...

156
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:26,909
<i>And next to Mama, no one ever
talked to me or asked me questions.</i>

157
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:29,411
Are you stupid or something?

158
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:32,498
Mama says, "Stupid is as stupid does."

159
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:37,795
- I'm Jenny.
- I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

160
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:40,297
<i>From that day on,
we was always together.</i>

161
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:43,217
<i>Jenny and me was like
peas and carrots.</i>

162
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:48,430
<i>She taught me how to climb.</i>

163
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:51,225
Come on, Forrest, you can do it.

164
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,936
<i>I showed her how to dangle.</i>

165
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,063
"...a good little monkey and..."

166
00:14:56,146 --> 00:15:01,068
<i>She helped me learn how to read,
and I showed her how to swing.</i>

167
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:07,157
<i>Sometimes we'd just sit out
and wait for the stars.</i>

168
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:12,162
- Mama's gonna worry about me.
- Just stay a little longer.

169
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:17,167
<i>For some reason,
Jenny didn't never want to go home.</i>

170
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:19,336
Okay, Jenny, I'll stay.

171
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,923
<i>She was my most special friend.</i>

172
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,012
My only friend.

173
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:35,603
Now, my mama always told me that
miracles happen every day.

174
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:38,063
Some people don't think so, but they do.

175
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,693
Hey, dummy!

176
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,738
Are you retarded, or just plain stupid?

177
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:49,325
- "Look, I'm Forrest Gimp."
- Just run away, Forrest.

178
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:53,746
Run, Forrest! Run away! Hurry!

179
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:57,082
- Get the bikes!
- Hurry up! Let's get him!

180
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,710
- Come on!
- Look out, dummy, here we come!

181
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,629
We're gonna get you!

182
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:06,342
Run, Forrest, run! Run, Forrest!

183
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:09,970
Come back here, you!

184
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:26,070
Run, Forrest!

185
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:27,571
Run!

186
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:01,647
<i>Now, you wouldn't believe it
if I told you,</i>

187
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:05,275
but I can run like the wind blows.

188
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:11,615
From that day on,
if I was going somewhere,

189
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,742
I was running!

190
00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:16,203
He's getting away! Stop him!

191
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:50,654
That boy sure is a running fool.

192
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:56,243
<i>Now, remember how I told you that</i>

193
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:59,246
<i>Jenny never seemed
to want to go home?</i>

194
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:02,416
<i>Well, she lived in a house
that was as old as Alabama.</i>

195
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,668
<i>Her mama had gone up to heaven
when she was five,</i>

196
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:08,088
<i>and her daddy was
some kind of a farmer.</i>

197
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:10,966
Jenny?

198
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,218
<i>He was a very loving man.</i>

199
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:17,931
<i>He was always kissing and touching
her and her sisters.</i>

200
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:24,104
<i>And then this one time,
Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school.</i>

201
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:27,232
Jenny, why didn't you come
to school today?

202
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,277
Daddy's taking a nap.

203
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,070
- Jenny!
- Come on!

204
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,074
Jenny, where'd you run to?

205
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:40,078
You'd better get back here, girl!

206
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,207
Where you at?

207
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:49,880
Jenny! Jenny! Where you at?

208
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:54,218
Jenny!

209
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:57,262
Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.

210
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,514
Jenny!

211
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:01,809
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

212
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:03,644
far, far away from here.

213
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:07,397
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

214
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:08,607
far, far away from here.

215
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:11,777
<i>Mama always said
that God is mysterious.</i>

216
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:13,028
Jenny!

217
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,447
<i>He didn't turn Jenny into a bird that day.</i>

218
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:16,657
You'd better get back here!

219
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,242
<i>Instead,</i>

220
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:23,455
<i>he had the police say Jenny didn't
have to stay in that house no more.</i>

221
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:27,626
<i>She went to live with her grandma
just over on Creekmore Avenue,</i>

222
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:30,921
<i>which made me happy,
'cause she was so close.</i>

223
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:38,554
<i>Some nights, Jenny would sneak out
and come on over to my house,</i>

224
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:41,765
<i>just 'cause she said she was scared.</i>

225
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:44,309
<i>Scared of what, I don't know,</i>

226
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:47,646
<i>but I think it was her grandma's dog.</i>

227
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,523
<i>He was a mean dog.</i>

228
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:52,985
<i>Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends</i>

229
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:54,361
<i>all the way up through high school.</i>

230
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:58,365
- Hey, stupid!
- Quit it!

231
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,785
- Run, Forrest, run!
- Hey,

232
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:03,954
did you hear me, stupid?

233
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,247
- Run, Forrest!
- Come on, get in the truck!

234
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,457
Get in the truck! Let's move it!

235
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,294
Come on, he's getting away! Move it!

236
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,546
Run, Forrest! Run!

237
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:16,174
- You better be running, stupid!
- Come on, dummy!

238
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:21,638
- Haul ass, dummy!
- Yeah, you better get running!

239
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,310
Jack rabbit!

240
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:35,986
Yeah!

241
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,989
Go! Go! Go!

242
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:42,326
Run, Forrest!

243
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:48,916
Now, it used to be,
I ran to get where I was going,

244
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,003
I never thought it would
take me anywhere.

245
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:26,203
- Who in the hell is that?
- That there is Forrest Gump, Coach.

246
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:29,039
Just a local idiot.

247
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:33,210
<i>And can you believe it?
I got to go to college, too.</i>

248
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,427
Forrest! Forrest! Run!

249
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,137
- Okay!
- Run!

250
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:47,766
Run, you stupid son of a bitch! Run!

251
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:02,781
You son of a bitch! Run! Go! Run!

252
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:07,911
No! Turn! Go!

253
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:22,759
He must be the stupidest
son of a bitch alive,

254
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:24,720
but he sure is fast!

255
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:32,769
<i>Now, maybe it's just me,
but college was very confusing times.</i>

256
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:36,023
<i>Federal troops enforcing a court order</i>

257
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:39,109
<i>integrated the University
of Alabama today.</i>

258
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:40,402
<i>Two negroes were admitted,</i>

259
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:43,780
<i>but only after Governor George Wallace
had carried out his symbolic threat</i>

260
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,407
<i>to stand in the school house door.</i>

261
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,162
<i>Governor Wallace,
I take it from that statement, that...</i>

262
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:52,289
Earl, what's going on?

263
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:55,709
- Coons are trying to get into school.
- Coons?

264
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,461
When raccoons try to get
on our back porch,

265
00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:59,337
Mama just chase them off with a broom.

266
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:03,967
Not raccoons, you idiot, niggers,
and they want to go to school with us.

267
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:06,511
With us? They do?

268
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:09,973
<i>Shortly after Governor
Wallace had carried out his promise</i>

269
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:11,266
<i>to block the doorway,</i>

270
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,310
<i>President Kennedy
ordered the Secretary of Defense</i>

271
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,395
<i>then to use military force.</i>

272
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:18,190
<i>Here, by videotape,
is the encounter by General Graham,</i>

273
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:21,568
<i>commander of the National Guard,
and Governor Wallace.</i>

274
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:25,363
<i>...because these National Guardsmen
are here today</i>

275
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,991
<i>as federal soldiers for Alabamans.</i>

276
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:31,995
<i>They live within our borders,
they are all our brothers.</i>

277
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,498
<i>We are winning in this fight,</i>

278
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:37,584
<i>because we are awakening
the American people</i>

279
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:41,004
<i>to the dangers that we have spoken
about so many times,</i>

280
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:47,385
<i>just so evident today, the trend towards
military dictatorship in this country.</i>

281
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:53,308
<i>And so, at day's end,
the University of Alabama</i>

282
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:55,685
<i>in Tuscaloosa had been desegregated</i>

283
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:58,772
<i>and students Jimmy Hood
and Vivian Malone</i>

284
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:01,942
<i>had been signed up
for summer classes.</i>

285
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:07,364
<i>Ma'am, you dropped your book.
Ma'am...</i>

286
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:09,866
<i>Governor Wallace did what
he promised to do.</i>

287
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,495
<i>By being on the Tuscaloosa campus,
he kept the mob from gathering...</i>

288
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:15,705
Say, wasn't that Gump?

289
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:19,876
- Nah, that couldn't be.
- It sure as hell was.

290
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:26,466
<i>A few years later,
that angry little man</i>

291
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,052
<i>at the school house door
thought it would be a good idea</i>

292
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:31,304
<i>and ran for president.</i>

293
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:37,060
<i>But somebody thought that it wasn't.</i>

294
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,814
But he didn't die.

295
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:47,070
My bus is here.

296
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:50,907
- Is it the number nine?
- No, it's the number four.

297
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:54,077
It was nice talking to you.

298
00:24:56,997 --> 00:25:01,084
I remember when that happened,
when Wallace got shot.

299
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,420
I was in college.

300
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:04,713
Did you go to a girls' college,

301
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:06,631
or to a girls-and-boys-together college?

302
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:07,757
It was co-ed.

303
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:10,552
'Cause Jenny went to a college
I couldn't go to.

304
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:12,971
It was a college just for girls.

305
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:16,266
<i>But I'd go and visit her
every chance I got.</i>

306
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:48,632
That hurts.

307
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,561
Forrest! Forrest!

308
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:06,733
- Forrest, stop it! Stop it!
- Jesus!

309
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:07,943
What are you doing?

310
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:09,694
- He was hurting you.
- What the hell is going on here?

311
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:13,490
- No, he's not! Get over there!
- Who is that? Who is that?

312
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:14,658
- Billy, I'm sorry.
- What the hell?

313
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:17,327
- Just get away from me!
- Don't...

314
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:20,372
- Don't go! Billy, wait a second!
- Get away from me.

315
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:22,666
He doesn't know any better!

316
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:27,087
Forrest, why did you do that?

317
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:33,009
I brought you some chocolate.

318
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:35,095
I'm sorry.

319
00:26:37,264 --> 00:26:40,558
- I'll go back to my college now.
- Forrest...

320
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:45,855
Look at you.

321
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:50,026
Come on. Come on.

322
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:59,411
- Is this your room?
- Shh!

323
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:06,126
Do you ever dream, Forrest,

324
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,297
about who you're gonna be?

325
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,173
- Who I'm gonna be?
- Yeah.

326
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:14,134
Aren't I going to be me?

327
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:17,887
Well, you'll always be you,
just another kind of you.

328
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:22,058
You know? I want to be famous.

329
00:27:23,768 --> 00:27:26,563
I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.

330
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:30,900
I just want to be on an empty stage

331
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:33,278
with my guitar, my voice.

332
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:36,573
Just me.

333
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:41,411
And I want to reach people
on the personal level.

334
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,417
I want to be able to say things,
just one-to-one.

335
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:57,802
Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest?

336
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:03,099
I sit next to them in my Home
Economics class all the time.

337
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:34,464
- I'm... Sorry.
- It's okay.

338
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:44,724
It's all right.

339
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,729
- It's okay.
- Oh, I'm dizzy.

340
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:01,157
I bet that never happened in Home Ec.

341
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,163
No.

342
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:16,506
I think I ruined
your roommate's bathrobe.

343
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:18,633
I don't care.
I don't like her, anyway.

344
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:22,095
Run! Run! Run!

345
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:26,683
- Run! Run! Run!
- Run! Run! Run!

346
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:38,820
<i>College ran by real fast,
'cause I played so much football.</i>

347
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:42,157
<i>They even put me on a thing
called the All-America Team,</i>

348
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,035
<i>where you get to meet
the President of the United States.</i>

349
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,704
<i>President Kennedy met
with the Collegiate</i>

350
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:51,374
<i>All-American Football Team
at the Oval Office today.</i>

351
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:53,960
<i>Now, the really good thing
about meeting</i>

352
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:57,839
<i>the President of the United States
is the food.</i>

353
00:29:57,922 --> 00:30:00,633
<i>They put you in this little room
with just about anything</i>

354
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:03,219
<i>you'd want to eat or drink.</i>

355
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,182
<i>And since, number one,
I wasn't hungry, but thirsty,</i>

356
00:30:07,265 --> 00:30:09,934
<i>and number two, they was free,</i>

357
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:13,104
<i>I must have drank me about
15 Dr. Peppers.</i>

358
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:18,193
<i>Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?</i>

359
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:20,028
<i>It's an honor, sir.</i>

360
00:30:20,111 --> 00:30:22,197
<i>Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?</i>

361
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,907
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

362
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:27,160
<i>Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?</i>

363
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:28,995
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

364
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:32,749
<i>- Congratulations. How do you feel?
- I gotta pee.</i>

365
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:35,710
<i>I believe he said
he had to "go pee."</i>

366
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:53,811
<i>Sometime later,
for no particular reason,</i>

367
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:56,314
<i>somebody shot that
nice young President,</i>

368
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:58,816
<i>when he was riding in his car.</i>

369
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:03,571
<i>And a few years after that,
somebody shot his little brother, too,</i>

370
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:05,782
<i>only he was in a hotel kitchen.</i>

371
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:09,661
It must be hard being brothers.

372
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:11,871
I wouldn't know.

373
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:13,831
<i>Forrest Gump.</i>

374
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:15,208
<i>Now can you believe it?</i>

375
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:19,212
<i>After only five years of playing football,
I got a college degree.</i>

376
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:21,297
Congratulations, son.

377
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,133
<i>Mama was so proud.</i>

378
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:29,305
Forrest, I'm so proud of you.
Here, I'll hold this for you.

379
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,516
Congratulations, son.

380
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:34,644
Have you given any thought
to your future?

381
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:37,814
Thought?

382
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:41,109
Hello, I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

383
00:31:41,192 --> 00:31:44,195
Nobody gives a hunk of shit
who you are, fuzzball!

384
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,948
You're not even a low-life,
scum-sucking maggot!

385
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:50,994
Get your faggotty ass on the bus.
You're in the Army now!

386
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:53,121
This seat's taken.

387
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:56,374
Taken.

388
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:02,088
<i>At first, it seemed like
I made a mistake,</i>

389
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:04,215
<i>seeing how it was only my induction day</i>

390
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,051
<i>and I was already getting yelled at.</i>

391
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:12,390
You can sit down if you want to.

392
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:16,352
<i>I didn't know who I might meet,
or what they might ask.</i>

393
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:19,063
You ever been on a real shrimp boat?

394
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:23,192
No, but I been on a real big boat.

395
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:26,779
I'm talking about
a shrimp-catching boat.

396
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:29,365
I've been working
on shrimp boats all my life.

397
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,243
I started out on my uncle's boat,
that's my mama's brother,

398
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:34,412
when I was about maybe nine.

399
00:32:34,537 --> 00:32:38,666
I was just looking into buying a boat
of my own and got drafted.

400
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:44,380
My given name is Benjamin Buford Blue.
People call me Bubba.

401
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:48,676
Just like one of them old redneck boys.
Can you believe that?

402
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,430
My name's Forrest Gump.
People call me Forrest Gump.

403
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:55,808
<i>So, Bubba was from
Bayou La Batre, Alabama,</i>

404
00:32:55,892 --> 00:32:57,810
<i>and his mama cooked shrimp,</i>

405
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:02,940
<i>and her mama before her
cooked shrimp,</i>

406
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:06,027
<i>and her mama before her mama
cooked shrimp, too.</i>

407
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,320
<i>Bubba's family knew everything</i>

408
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:10,031
<i>there was to know
about the shrimping business.</i>

409
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:13,159
I know everything there is to know
about the shrimping business.

410
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:16,245
Matter of fact, I'm going into
the shrimping business for myself

411
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:18,706
after I get out the Army.

412
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:22,418
Okay.

413
00:33:22,627 --> 00:33:26,714
Gump! What's your sole purpose
in this Army?

414
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:29,342
To do whatever you tell me,
Drill Sergeant!

415
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:32,804
God damn it, Gump!
You're a goddamn genius!

416
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:35,264
That's the most outstanding answer
I've ever heard.

417
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,142
You must have a goddamn IQ of 160!

418
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:41,229
You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump!

419
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,107
Listen up, people!

420
00:33:44,232 --> 00:33:48,403
<i>Now, for some reason, I fit in
the Army like one of them round pegs.</i>

421
00:33:48,486 --> 00:33:49,737
<i>It's not really hard.</i>

422
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:53,449
<i>You just make your bed real neat
and remember to stand up straight,</i>

423
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:57,537
<i>and always answer every question
with, "Yes, Drill Sergeant!"</i>

424
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,080
Is that clear?

425
00:33:59,163 --> 00:34:01,290
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!

426
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:05,086
What you do is, you just drag
your nets along the bottom.

427
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:08,923
On a good day, you can catch over
100 pounds of shrimp.

428
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:12,427
If everything goes all right,
two men shrimping 10 hours,

429
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:15,221
less what you spend on gas, you can...

430
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:18,099
- Done, Drill Sergeant!
- Gump!

431
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:23,229
Why did you put that weapon
together so quickly, Gump?

432
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:24,981
You told me to, Drill Sergeant.

433
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:28,526
Jesus H. Christ,
this is a new company record.

434
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:31,112
If it wouldn't be a waste
of such a damn fine enlisted man,

435
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:33,489
I'd recommend you for OCS,
Private Gump.

436
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:35,450
You are gonna be
a general some day, Gump.

437
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:38,619
Now, disassemble your weapon
and continue!

438
00:34:40,705 --> 00:34:44,500
Anyway, like I was saying,
shrimp is the fruit of the sea.

439
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:49,338
You can barbecue it,
boil it, broil it, bake it, sauté it.

440
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:52,425
There's shrimp kebabs, shrimp Creole...

441
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:57,555
...shrimp gumbo, pan fried,
deep fried, stir fried.

442
00:34:57,889 --> 00:35:01,434
There's pineapple shrimp,
lemon shrimp,

443
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:03,853
coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp...

444
00:35:04,187 --> 00:35:10,151
...shrimp soup, shrimp stew,
shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes,

445
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:13,279
shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich...

446
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:18,201
That's... That's about it.

447
00:35:21,913 --> 00:35:24,874
<i>Night time in the Army
is a lonely time.</i>

448
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:29,378
<i>We'd lay there in our bunks
and I'd miss my mama.</i>

449
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:32,465
<i>And I'd miss Jenny.</i>

450
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:40,264
Hey, Gump, get a load of the tits on her!

451
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:56,864
<i>Turns out, Jenny had gotten into
some trouble over</i>

452
00:35:56,948 --> 00:36:00,284
<i>some photos of her
in her college sweater,</i>

453
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:02,954
<i>and she was thrown out of school.</i>

454
00:36:06,499 --> 00:36:08,709
<i>But that wasn't a bad thing,</i>

455
00:36:08,793 --> 00:36:12,380
<i>because a man who owns
a theater in Memphis, Tennessee,</i>

456
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:17,510
<i>saw those photos and offered Jenny
a job singing in a show.</i>

457
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:20,137
<i>The first chance I got,</i>

458
00:36:20,263 --> 00:36:23,933
<i>I took the bus up to Memphis
to see her perform in that show.</i>

459
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:25,518
<i>That was Amber, Amber Flame.</i>

460
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:28,062
<i>Give her a big hand, guys.
Good job, Amber.</i>

461
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:30,898
<i>And now, for your listening
and viewing pleasure,</i>

462
00:36:30,982 --> 00:36:34,819
<i>direct from Hollywood, California,
our very own beatnik beauty,</i>

463
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:38,614
<i>let's give a big round of applause
to the luscious Bobbi Dylan.</i>

464
00:36:40,783 --> 00:36:43,035
- All right!
- Bobbi!

465
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:08,060
<i>Her dream had come true.</i>

466
00:37:09,312 --> 00:37:11,314
<i>She was a folk singer.</i>

467
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:22,825
Come on, baby. Shake it up.
Shake it up, now.

468
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:24,410
Hey, buddy, get her a harmonica.

469
00:37:28,164 --> 00:37:30,207
Hey, honey,
this ain't <i>Captain Kangaroo.</i>

470
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,877
Hey, honey,
I got something here for you.

471
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,673
- God damn it!
- Hey! Hey! Stupid jerk!

472
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:40,217
I'm singing a song here.

473
00:37:42,553 --> 00:37:44,972
Polly, get out here!

474
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:46,766
- Shut up, there!
- Don't be so shy, honey.

475
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:48,392
Oh, shut up!

476
00:37:51,062 --> 00:37:53,814
Forrest, what are you doing here?

477
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:55,608
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

478
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:57,068
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

479
00:37:57,193 --> 00:37:59,195
Forrest, let me down!

480
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:06,953
You can't keep doing this, Forrest.

481
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:09,121
You can't keep trying
to rescue me all the time.

482
00:38:09,205 --> 00:38:13,292
- They was trying to grab you.
- A lot of people try to grab me.

483
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:17,380
Just... You can't keep
doing this all the time.

484
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,800
I can't help it. I love you.

485
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:25,262
Forrest, you don't know what love is.

486
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:35,564
You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?

487
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,945
We prayed for God to turn me
into a bird so I could fly far, far away?

488
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:44,281
Yes, I do.

489
00:38:48,244 --> 00:38:51,080
You think I could fly off this bridge?

490
00:38:57,753 --> 00:38:59,922
What do you mean, Jenny?

491
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:05,302
Nothing.

492
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:10,307
I gotta get out of here.

493
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:13,686
Wait, Jenny...

494
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:18,232
Forrest, you stay away from me, okay?
You just stay away from me, please.

495
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:19,608
Can I have a ride?

496
00:39:19,692 --> 00:39:21,235
- Where you going?
- I don't care.

497
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:22,695
Get in the truck.

498
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:24,613
So, bye-bye, Jenny.

499
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:29,452
They sending me to Vietnam.

500
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:34,623
It's this whole other country.

501
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:39,128
Just hang on a minute.

502
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:43,591
Listen, you promise me
something, okay?

503
00:39:43,674 --> 00:39:47,011
Just, if you're ever in trouble,
don't try to be brave. You just run, okay?

504
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:48,721
Just run away.

505
00:39:49,972 --> 00:39:51,307
Okay.

506
00:39:56,187 --> 00:39:57,521
Jenny.

507
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:01,692
I'll write you all the time.

508
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:13,829
<i>And just like that,
she was gone.</i>

509
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:33,265
You come back safe to me,
do you hear?

510
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:20,521
<i>Now, they told us that Vietnam
was gonna be very different</i>

511
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:23,482
<i>from the United States of America.</i>

512
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:28,612
<i>And except for all the beer cans
and the barbecue, it was.</i>

513
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:41,834
Hey, I bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.

514
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:45,087
They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimpers.

515
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:48,716
You know, after we win this war,
and we take over everything,

516
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:50,009
we can get American shrimpers

517
00:41:50,092 --> 00:41:51,844
to come out here
and shrimp these waters.

518
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:53,470
We'll just shrimp all the time, man.

519
00:41:53,596 --> 00:41:56,765
So much shrimp, why,
you wouldn't believe it.

520
00:41:57,433 --> 00:41:59,351
You must be my FNGs.

521
00:41:59,435 --> 00:42:00,686
- Morning, sir!
- Morning, sir!

522
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:03,397
Get your hands down! Do not salute me.

523
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,608
There's goddamn snipers
all around this area

524
00:42:05,691 --> 00:42:08,527
who would love to grease an officer.

525
00:42:08,611 --> 00:42:12,114
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fourth Platoon.

526
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,409
What's wrong with your lip?

527
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:17,870
I was born with big gums, sir.

528
00:42:17,953 --> 00:42:22,666
Yeah, well, you better tuck that in.
Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.

529
00:42:23,834 --> 00:42:25,211
Where you boys from in the world?

530
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:27,671
- Alabama, sir!
- Alabama, sir!

531
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,882
You twins?

532
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:34,386
No, we are not relations, sir.

533
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:39,558
Look, it's pretty basic here.

534
00:42:40,351 --> 00:42:42,811
If you stick with me
and learn from the guys

535
00:42:42,895 --> 00:42:45,564
who've been in country a while,
you'll be all right.

536
00:42:45,648 --> 00:42:47,566
There is one item of GI gear

537
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:51,820
that can be the difference between
a live grunt and a dead grunt.

538
00:42:52,154 --> 00:42:55,324
Socks. Cushion sole, OD green.

539
00:42:55,407 --> 00:42:56,700
Try and keep your feet dry.

540
00:42:56,825 --> 00:42:58,244
When we're out humping,
I want you boys to remember

541
00:42:58,327 --> 00:43:00,788
to change your socks whenever we stop.

542
00:43:00,871 --> 00:43:03,832
The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet
right off his legs.

543
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:06,210
Sergeant Sims, God damn it,

544
00:43:06,335 --> 00:43:07,753
where is that sling rope
I told you to order?

545
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:09,755
I put in the requisitions at Battalion.

546
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:11,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, well,
you call those sons of bitches again...

547
00:43:11,924 --> 00:43:14,468
<i>Lieutenant Dan
sure knew his stuff.</i>

548
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:16,845
<i>I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant.</i>

549
00:43:17,596 --> 00:43:21,058
<i>He was from a long,
great military tradition.</i>

550
00:43:21,267 --> 00:43:24,353
<i>Somebody in his family
had fought and died</i>

551
00:43:25,354 --> 00:43:29,608
<i>in every single American war.</i>

552
00:43:30,526 --> 00:43:32,528
- God damn it, kick some ass!
- I'm on it, Lieutenant.

553
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:33,737
Get on it!

554
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:37,199
<i>I guess you could say he had
a lot to live up to.</i>

555
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:43,747
So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh?
Well, I've been through there.

556
00:43:43,872 --> 00:43:46,041
Little Rock's a fine town.

557
00:43:46,709 --> 00:43:50,296
Now, go shake down your gear,
see the platoon sergeant,

558
00:43:50,379 --> 00:43:52,840
draw what you need for the field.

559
00:43:52,923 --> 00:43:56,885
If you boys are hungry,
we got steaks burning right over here.

560
00:43:56,969 --> 00:43:59,847
Two standing orders in this platoon:

561
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,599
one, take good care of your feet,

562
00:44:02,725 --> 00:44:07,771
two, try not to do anything stupid,
like getting yourself killed.

563
00:44:14,236 --> 00:44:16,322
I sure hope I don't let him down.

564
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:30,419
<i>I got to see
a lot of the countryside.</i>

565
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:32,838
<i>We would take these real long walks.</i>

566
00:44:41,305 --> 00:44:45,434
<i>And we were always looking
for this guy named Charlie.</i>

567
00:44:53,275 --> 00:44:55,527
- Hold it up!
- Hold up, boys!

568
00:44:58,364 --> 00:45:00,699
<i>It wasn't always fun.</i>

569
00:45:00,783 --> 00:45:05,079
<i>Lieutenant Dan was always getting
these funny feelings about a rock,</i>

570
00:45:05,162 --> 00:45:10,250
<i>or a trail, or the road,
so he'd tell us to get down, shut up...</i>

571
00:45:10,334 --> 00:45:12,336
Get down! Shut up!

572
00:45:13,295 --> 00:45:14,755
<i>...so we did.</i>

573
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:34,483
<i>Now, I don't know much about anything,</i>

574
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:38,404
<i>but I think some of America's
best young men served in this war.</i>

575
00:45:38,487 --> 00:45:41,198
<i>There was Dallas, from Phoenix,</i>

576
00:45:42,908 --> 00:45:45,702
<i>Cleveland, he was from Detroit.</i>

577
00:45:45,828 --> 00:45:48,205
Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex.

578
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:50,499
Man, what the hell's going on?

579
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:54,920
<i>And Tex was... Well, I don't remember
where Tex come from.</i>

580
00:45:55,003 --> 00:45:56,547
Nothing.

581
00:46:00,676 --> 00:46:03,178
Fourth Platoon, on your feet.

582
00:46:03,262 --> 00:46:06,974
Still got 10 klicks to go to that river.
Move out.

583
00:46:07,057 --> 00:46:08,851
Come on, move out.

584
00:46:10,894 --> 00:46:13,313
Step it up. Look alive out there.

585
00:46:13,397 --> 00:46:17,734
<i>The good thing about Vietnam
is there was always some place to go.</i>

586
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,236
Fire in the hole!

587
00:46:22,698 --> 00:46:25,033
Gump, check out that hole.

588
00:46:25,117 --> 00:46:28,120
<i>And there was always something to do.</i>

589
00:46:28,203 --> 00:46:31,373
- Mount them up.
- Spread out! Cover his back.

590
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:42,050
<i>One day, it started raining,
and it didn't quit for four months.</i>

591
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:45,929
<i>We'd been through
every kind of rain there is:</i>

592
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:48,599
<i>little bitty stinging rain,</i>

593
00:46:49,308 --> 00:46:51,977
<i>and big old fat rain,</i>

594
00:46:52,436 --> 00:46:55,147
<i>rain that flew in sideways.</i>

595
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:59,276
<i>And sometimes, rain even seemed
to come straight up from underneath.</i>

596
00:47:01,069 --> 00:47:03,447
<i>Shoot, it even rained at night.</i>

597
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:06,950
- Hey, Forrest.
- Hey, Bubba.

598
00:47:07,075 --> 00:47:10,370
I'm gonna lean up against you.
You just lean right back against me.

599
00:47:10,454 --> 00:47:14,291
This way, we don't have to sleep
with our heads in the mud.

600
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:18,712
You know why we a good partnership,
Forrest?

601
00:47:18,795 --> 00:47:21,298
'Cause we be watching out
for one another,

602
00:47:21,423 --> 00:47:23,300
like brothers and stuff.

603
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,931
Hey, Forrest, there's something
I've been thinking about.

604
00:47:29,014 --> 00:47:32,017
I got a very important question
to ask you.

605
00:47:33,644 --> 00:47:37,606
How would you like to go
into the shrimping business with me?

606
00:47:38,774 --> 00:47:40,400
Okay.

607
00:47:40,484 --> 00:47:43,946
Man, I tell you what,
I got it all figured out, too.

608
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:46,823
So many pounds of shrimp
to pay off the boat,

609
00:47:46,949 --> 00:47:50,244
so many pounds for gas,
we can just live right on the boat.

610
00:47:50,327 --> 00:47:52,621
We ain't got to pay no rent.

611
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:54,790
I'll be the captain,
we can just work it together,

612
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:59,127
split everything right down the middle.
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.

613
00:47:59,211 --> 00:48:02,798
And, hey, Forrest,
all the shrimp you can eat.

614
00:48:04,341 --> 00:48:06,134
That's a fine idea.

615
00:48:07,219 --> 00:48:09,346
<i>Bubba did have a fine idea.</i>

616
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:16,228
<i>I even wrote Jenny
and told her all about it.</i>

617
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:20,232
<i>I sent her letters,
not every day, but almost.</i>

618
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:25,320
<i>I told her what I was doing
and asked her what she was doing,</i>

619
00:48:25,404 --> 00:48:28,156
<i>and told her
how I thought about her always,</i>

620
00:48:29,491 --> 00:48:32,452
<i>and how I was looking forward
to getting a letter from her</i>

621
00:48:32,536 --> 00:48:35,038
<i>just as soon as she had the time.</i>

622
00:48:36,915 --> 00:48:39,418
<i>I'd always let her know that I was okay.</i>

623
00:48:40,711 --> 00:48:45,882
<i>Then, I'd sign each letter,
"Love, Forrest Gump."</i>

624
00:49:00,731 --> 00:49:04,484
<i>This one day, we was out walking,
like always,</i>

625
00:49:04,568 --> 00:49:07,529
<i>and then, just like that,</i>

626
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:11,867
<i>somebody turned off the rain
and the sun come out.</i>

627
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:16,705
Ambush!

628
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:18,582
Take cover!

629
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:23,378
Get down!

630
00:49:23,462 --> 00:49:24,921
Get the sixty!

631
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:30,177
Get that pig up here, God damn it!

632
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,387
Forrest, you okay?

633
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,226
Strongarm! Strongarm!
Be advised, Strongarm!

634
00:49:38,769 --> 00:49:41,188
Medic, we got a man down!

635
00:49:41,271 --> 00:49:44,232
Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6, over!

636
00:49:44,941 --> 00:49:48,278
Roger, Strongarm, be advised
we have incoming from the tree line

637
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:51,907
at points blue plus two.
AKs and rockets...

638
00:49:52,574 --> 00:49:54,368
Misfire! Misfire!

639
00:49:56,745 --> 00:49:58,747
God damn it! Mac!

640
00:49:59,706 --> 00:50:03,126
Get that thing...
Fuck it, get it in the tree line!

641
00:50:04,086 --> 00:50:05,253
Jesus!

642
00:50:05,379 --> 00:50:07,589
My unit is down hard and hurting!

643
00:50:07,714 --> 00:50:11,259
Six are pulling back to Blue Line,
Leg Lima 6 out.

644
00:50:12,052 --> 00:50:14,012
Pull back! Pull back!

645
00:50:14,096 --> 00:50:16,223
Run! Run, Forrest!

646
00:50:16,306 --> 00:50:18,642
- Pull back!
- Forrest, Forrest!

647
00:50:18,767 --> 00:50:21,353
Run, man! Run!

648
00:50:21,436 --> 00:50:23,230
Pull back! Run!

649
00:50:25,065 --> 00:50:27,275
Run, God damn it, run!

650
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:53,093
Medic! Can I get a medic?

651
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:56,805
<i>I ran and ran,
just like Jenny told me to.</i>

652
00:51:00,183 --> 00:51:04,396
<i>I ran so far and so fast
that pretty soon I was all by myself,</i>

653
00:51:04,479 --> 00:51:06,440
<i>which was a bad thing.</i>

654
00:51:06,982 --> 00:51:08,525
Bubba!

655
00:51:10,652 --> 00:51:14,448
<i>Bubba was my best good friend.
I had to make sure that he was okay.</i>

656
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,203
Any friendlies out there?

657
00:51:21,163 --> 00:51:23,331
Yeah, I've got
three over here.

658
00:51:23,957 --> 00:51:25,959
Where the hell are you?

659
00:51:26,543 --> 00:51:27,878
Bubba?

660
00:51:28,962 --> 00:51:31,673
<i>And on my way back to find Bubba,</i>

661
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:34,593
<i>well, there was this boy
laying on the ground.</i>

662
00:51:34,676 --> 00:51:35,886
Tex!

663
00:51:37,971 --> 00:51:38,972
Okay.

664
00:51:39,055 --> 00:51:43,018
<i>I couldn't just let him lay there all alone,
scared the way he was,</i>

665
00:51:43,143 --> 00:51:47,022
<i>so I grabbed him up
and run him out of there.</i>

666
00:52:02,162 --> 00:52:04,581
<i>And every time I went back
looking for Bubba,</i>

667
00:52:04,706 --> 00:52:08,210
<i>somebody else was saying,
"Help me, Forrest. Help me."</i>

668
00:52:15,884 --> 00:52:17,761
Can't hear... Can't hear...

669
00:52:20,055 --> 00:52:21,348
No sweat, man. Just lay back.

670
00:52:21,431 --> 00:52:23,934
You'll be okay. You'll be okay.

671
00:52:25,936 --> 00:52:28,980
<i>I started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.</i>

672
00:52:29,064 --> 00:52:30,315
<i>MAN ON RADIO:... over.</i>

673
00:52:30,398 --> 00:52:33,693
Roger, Strongarm,
I know my position is danger close.

674
00:52:33,777 --> 00:52:35,612
We got Charlie all over this area.

675
00:52:35,737 --> 00:52:38,031
I gotta have those fast movers
in here now. Over.

676
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:41,493
<i>- Six, Strongarm, we want...</i>
- Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!

677
00:52:41,576 --> 00:52:42,786
I know he's dead!

678
00:52:42,911 --> 00:52:45,747
My whole goddamn platoon
is wiped out!

679
00:52:45,872 --> 00:52:47,207
<i>- Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6.</i>
- God damn it!

680
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:50,001
<i>- Copy this transmission. Over.</i>
- What are you doing?

681
00:52:50,085 --> 00:52:53,421
Just leave me here! Get away.
Just leave me here! Get out!

682
00:52:53,547 --> 00:52:55,841
<i>Leg Lima 6, Strongarm.
How copy this? Over.</i>

683
00:52:55,924 --> 00:52:58,552
God, I said leave me here, God damn it!

684
00:52:58,635 --> 00:53:01,805
<i>Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6,
this is Strongarm, be advised</i>

685
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:03,890
<i>your fast movers
are inbound at this time, over.</i>

686
00:53:03,974 --> 00:53:07,394
<i>Then, it felt like something
just jumped up and bit me.</i>

687
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:09,938
Something bit me!

688
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,947
You chink son of a bitch!

689
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:23,451
I can't leave the platoon.

690
00:53:23,577 --> 00:53:28,498
I told you to leave me there, Gump.
Forget about me. Get yourself out!

691
00:53:28,623 --> 00:53:30,750
Did you hear what I said?

692
00:53:31,459 --> 00:53:33,420
God damn it, put me down!

693
00:53:34,129 --> 00:53:36,172
Get your ass out of here!

694
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:42,053
I didn't ask you to pull me out of there,
God damn you!

695
00:53:42,137 --> 00:53:43,471
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

696
00:53:43,597 --> 00:53:44,681
To get Bubba.

697
00:53:44,806 --> 00:53:48,643
I got an air strike inbound right now.
They're gonna nape the whole area.

698
00:53:48,768 --> 00:53:51,146
Gump, you stay here, God damn it!
That's an order!

699
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:53,690
I gotta find Bubba!

700
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:11,124
Forrest.

701
00:54:18,882 --> 00:54:21,551
- Bubba.
- I'm okay, Forrest.

702
00:54:22,344 --> 00:54:24,012
I'm okay.

703
00:54:31,853 --> 00:54:33,688
Oh, Bubba, no...

704
00:54:33,813 --> 00:54:36,024
Nah, I'm gonna be all right.

705
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:46,868
Come on. Come on. Come on.

706
00:54:51,873 --> 00:54:53,375
I'm okay, Forrest.

707
00:54:54,709 --> 00:54:57,545
I'm okay, man. I'm fine.

708
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:37,711
Helo's inbound.
Top smoke, get it out there!

709
00:55:38,753 --> 00:55:43,258
<i>If I'd a known this was gonna be the
last time me and Bubba was gonna talk,</i>

710
00:55:43,383 --> 00:55:45,677
<i>I'd of thought of something better to say.</i>

711
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,262
Hey, Bubba.

712
00:55:48,388 --> 00:55:49,764
Hey, Forrest.

713
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,311
Forrest, why'd this happen?

714
00:55:56,646 --> 00:55:58,440
You got shot.

715
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:04,320
<i>Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget.</i>

716
00:56:05,113 --> 00:56:06,781
I wanna go home.

717
00:56:08,783 --> 00:56:10,827
<i>Bubba was my best good friend.</i>

718
00:56:11,786 --> 00:56:16,332
<i>And even I know that ain't something
you can find just around the corner.</i>

719
00:56:16,458 --> 00:56:19,544
<i>Bubba was gonna be
a shrimping boat captain,</i>

720
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:23,590
<i>but instead he died right there
by that river in Vietnam.</i>

721
00:56:29,304 --> 00:56:31,598
That's all I have to say about that.

722
00:56:33,975 --> 00:56:36,144
It was a bullet, wasn't it?

723
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,149
- A bullet?
- That jumped up and bit you.

724
00:56:43,526 --> 00:56:45,612
Oh, yes, sir.

725
00:56:45,695 --> 00:56:48,823
Bit me directly in the buttocks.

726
00:56:48,948 --> 00:56:54,204
They said it was a million-dollar wound,
but the Army must keep that money,

727
00:56:54,329 --> 00:56:58,166
'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.

728
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,504
The only good thing
about being wounded in the buttocks

729
00:57:02,629 --> 00:57:04,339
<i>is the ice cream.</i>

730
00:57:04,464 --> 00:57:07,050
<i>They gave me all the ice cream
I could eat.</i>

731
00:57:07,175 --> 00:57:08,468
<i>And guess what?</i>

732
00:57:08,551 --> 00:57:11,679
<i>A good friend of mine
was in the bed right next door.</i>

733
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:16,976
Lieutenant Dan,
I got you some ice cream.

734
00:57:19,354 --> 00:57:21,523
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream.

735
00:57:33,243 --> 00:57:35,537
It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.

736
00:57:44,045 --> 00:57:45,380
Harper!

737
00:57:48,591 --> 00:57:51,052
Cooper, Larson,

738
00:57:53,263 --> 00:57:54,597
Webster,

739
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:59,519
- Gump. Gump.
- I'm Forrest Gump.

740
00:58:03,064 --> 00:58:06,359
Kyle, Nichols,

741
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:14,534
McMill, Johnson, Tyler,

742
00:58:15,869 --> 00:58:17,245
Holiday...

743
00:58:24,002 --> 00:58:26,254
<i>Surprise, surprise, surprise!</i>

744
00:58:29,591 --> 00:58:32,093
Gump, how can you watch
that stupid shit?

745
00:58:32,177 --> 00:58:33,761
<i>- From the DMZ to the Delta...</i>
- Turn it off!

746
00:58:33,845 --> 00:58:37,098
<i>...you are tuned to the
American Forces Vietnam Network.</i>

747
00:58:37,223 --> 00:58:39,559
<i>This is Channel 6, Saigon.</i>

748
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:43,938
Good catch, Gump.

749
00:58:45,899 --> 00:58:48,067
You know how to play this?

750
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,446
Come on, let me show you. Here.

751
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:55,867
Now, the secret to this game is,

752
00:58:55,950 --> 00:59:01,789
no matter what happens,
never ever take your eye off the ball.

753
00:59:05,376 --> 00:59:06,711
All right.

754
00:59:10,048 --> 00:59:13,718
<i>For some reason,
Ping-Pong came very natural to me.</i>

755
00:59:14,052 --> 00:59:16,971
See? Any idiot can play.

756
00:59:17,472 --> 00:59:20,225
<i>So, I started playing it all the time.</i>

757
00:59:21,392 --> 00:59:22,727
<i>I played Ping-Pong</i>

758
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:26,105
<i>even when I didn't have anyone
to play Ping-Pong with.</i>

759
00:59:34,155 --> 00:59:38,826
<i>The hospital's people said
it made me look like a duck in water,</i>

760
00:59:38,952 --> 00:59:40,787
<i>whatever that means.</i>

761
00:59:41,246 --> 00:59:44,499
<i>Even Lieutenant Dan would come
and watch me play.</i>

762
00:59:50,004 --> 00:59:53,883
<i>I played Ping-Pong so much,
I even played it in my sleep.</i>

763
01:00:01,683 --> 01:00:06,771
Now, you listen to me.
We all have a destiny.

764
01:00:06,854 --> 01:00:09,899
Nothing just happens,
it's all part of a plan.

765
01:00:10,024 --> 01:00:12,694
I should have died out there
with my men,

766
01:00:12,819 --> 01:00:16,781
but now I'm nothing
but a goddamn cripple,

767
01:00:16,864 --> 01:00:20,493
a legless freak! Look! Look! Look at me!

768
01:00:21,244 --> 01:00:22,328
Do you see that?

769
01:00:22,412 --> 01:00:26,207
Do you know what it's like
not to be able to use your legs?

770
01:00:29,544 --> 01:00:31,170
Yes, sir, I do.

771
01:00:34,841 --> 01:00:36,884
Did you hear what I said?

772
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,512
You cheated me.

773
01:00:39,595 --> 01:00:40,763
I had a destiny.

774
01:00:40,847 --> 01:00:44,392
I was supposed to die in the field,
with honor!

775
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:49,105
That was my destiny,
and you cheated me out of it!

776
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:01,451
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Gump?

777
01:01:03,578 --> 01:01:06,956
This wasn't supposed to happen,
not to me.

778
01:01:09,584 --> 01:01:11,252
I had a destiny.

779
01:01:13,212 --> 01:01:17,592
I was Lieutenant Dan Taylor.

780
01:01:23,765 --> 01:01:26,100
You're still Lieutenant Dan.

781
01:01:49,332 --> 01:01:50,833
Look at me.

782
01:01:52,168 --> 01:01:54,128
What am I gonna do now?

783
01:01:57,799 --> 01:01:59,842
What am I gonna do now?

784
01:02:10,228 --> 01:02:11,687
PFC Gump?

785
01:02:13,231 --> 01:02:14,649
Yes, sir!

786
01:02:15,316 --> 01:02:16,818
As you were.

787
01:02:17,318 --> 01:02:21,155
Son, you've been awarded
the Medal of Honor.

788
01:02:22,198 --> 01:02:25,827
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan,
they want to give me a...

789
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:36,337
Ma'am, what'd they do
with Lieutenant Dan?

790
01:02:37,255 --> 01:02:39,048
They sent him home.

791
01:02:45,054 --> 01:02:47,807
<i>Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.</i>

792
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:52,395
<i>The ceremony was kicked off
with a candid speech by the President</i>

793
01:02:52,478 --> 01:02:55,857
<i>regarding the need for further escalation
of the war in Vietnam.</i>

794
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:58,067
<i>President Johnson awarded
four Medals of Honor</i>

795
01:02:58,151 --> 01:02:59,819
<i>to men
from each of the Armed Services.</i>

796
01:02:59,902 --> 01:03:02,822
<i>America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.</i>

797
01:03:04,824 --> 01:03:08,619
<i>I understand you were wounded.
Where were you hit?</i>

798
01:03:08,703 --> 01:03:11,873
<i>- In the buttocks, sir.
- That must be a sight.</i>

799
01:03:12,623 --> 01:03:14,917
<i>I'd kind of like to see that.</i>

800
01:03:29,056 --> 01:03:30,516
<i>God damn, son.</i>

801
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:36,481
<i>After that,
Mama went to the hotel to lay down,</i>

802
01:03:36,564 --> 01:03:40,067
<i>so I went out for a walk
to see our nation's capital.</i>

803
01:03:40,151 --> 01:03:41,694
Hilary, all right,
I've got the vets,

804
01:03:41,777 --> 01:03:43,279
what do you want me to do with them?

805
01:03:43,362 --> 01:03:45,114
What are you doing here
so late?

806
01:03:45,198 --> 01:03:49,243
<i>It's a good thing Mama was resting,
'cause the streets was awful crowded</i>

807
01:03:49,327 --> 01:03:52,497
<i>with people looking
at all the statues and monuments,</i>

808
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:55,208
<i>and some of them people were loud
and pushy.</i>

809
01:03:55,291 --> 01:03:58,252
Okay, follow me! Come on.
Let's move it out.

810
01:03:59,086 --> 01:04:02,048
<i>Everywhere I went,
I had to stand in line.</i>

811
01:04:05,301 --> 01:04:06,844
Follow me, let's go!

812
01:04:08,638 --> 01:04:10,264
Come on. Let's go.

813
01:04:16,312 --> 01:04:17,897
Stand here.

814
01:04:20,358 --> 01:04:23,528
Hey, you're a good man
for doing this. Good!

815
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:25,947
Okay.

816
01:04:26,739 --> 01:04:30,117
<i>There was this man giving a little talk.</i>

817
01:04:30,201 --> 01:04:33,704
<i>And for some reason, he was
wearing an American flag for a shirt.</i>

818
01:04:33,788 --> 01:04:35,248
<i>Now, I'm gonna
bring up some soldiers...</i>

819
01:04:35,331 --> 01:04:38,125
<i>And he liked to say the "F" word.</i>

820
01:04:38,209 --> 01:04:41,587
<i>A lot."F" this and "F" that.</i>

821
01:04:41,671 --> 01:04:44,006
<i>And every time he said the "F" word,</i>

822
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:46,842
<i>people, for some reason,
well, they'd cheer.</i>

823
01:04:46,926 --> 01:04:49,554
<i>...where to stick this fucking war! Yeah!</i>

824
01:04:51,055 --> 01:04:53,391
<i>Yeah! Yeah!</i>

825
01:04:53,975 --> 01:04:56,477
Come on, man, come up here, man.

826
01:04:56,894 --> 01:05:00,231
Come on. Come on. Yeah, you!
Come on. Move, move, move.

827
01:05:01,232 --> 01:05:04,652
You can do it. Just get up there.
Go on. That's it.

828
01:05:17,456 --> 01:05:20,001
<i>Tell us a little bit about the war, man.</i>

829
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:21,836
<i>The war in Vietnam?</i>

830
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:24,839
<i>- The war in Viet-fucking-nam!</i>
- Yeah!

831
01:05:45,192 --> 01:05:46,277
Peace!

832
01:05:46,652 --> 01:05:48,029
Come on, man, go!

833
01:05:48,321 --> 01:05:50,281
- Come on!
- Peace!

834
01:05:50,364 --> 01:05:51,407
<i>Well...</i>

835
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:54,952
<i>There was only one thing
I could say about the war in Vietnam.</i>

836
01:05:55,036 --> 01:05:59,874
<i>...there's only one thing
I can say about the war in Vietnam.</i>

837
01:06:03,669 --> 01:06:07,465
<i>In Vietnam, your...</i>

838
01:06:17,224 --> 01:06:18,309
Hey, what the hell are you...

839
01:06:18,392 --> 01:06:21,145
I'll beat your head in,
you goddamn oinker!

840
01:06:21,228 --> 01:06:23,731
Jesus Christ, what'd they do with this?

841
01:06:25,149 --> 01:06:26,817
We can't hear you!

842
01:06:28,527 --> 01:06:30,529
We can't hear anything!

843
01:06:31,238 --> 01:06:33,741
- This one! This one! Give me that!
- Turn it up!

844
01:06:33,824 --> 01:06:35,242
Speak up!

845
01:06:36,035 --> 01:06:37,495
That's it!

846
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:41,415
<i>...and that's all I have to say about that.</i>

847
01:06:48,714 --> 01:06:51,676
That's so right on, man. You said it all.

848
01:06:53,177 --> 01:06:55,680
What's your name, man?

849
01:06:55,763 --> 01:06:58,391
<i>My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.</i>

850
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:00,768
<i>Forrest Gump!</i>

851
01:07:00,893 --> 01:07:02,269
- Gump!
- Gump!

852
01:07:03,771 --> 01:07:07,525
Forrest! Forrest!

853
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:13,948
<i>- Jenny!</i>
- Forrest!

854
01:07:30,715 --> 01:07:33,384
Hey! Hey!

855
01:07:41,475 --> 01:07:44,603
<i>It was the happiest moment of my life.</i>

856
01:07:46,939 --> 01:07:50,317
<i>Jenny and me were just like
peas and carrots again.</i>

857
01:07:51,652 --> 01:07:53,237
<i>She showed me around,</i>

858
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,906
<i>and even introduced me
to some of her new friends.</i>

859
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:57,324
Shut that blind, man.

860
01:07:57,450 --> 01:07:59,660
And get your white ass
away from that window.

861
01:07:59,744 --> 01:08:01,829
Don't you know we in a war here?

862
01:08:02,663 --> 01:08:04,081
Hey, man, he's cool. He's cool.
He's one of us.

863
01:08:04,165 --> 01:08:06,083
- Let me tell you about us.
- Where the hell have you been?

864
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:08,252
Our purpose here
is to protect our black leaders

865
01:08:08,335 --> 01:08:10,087
from the racial onslaught of the pig

866
01:08:10,171 --> 01:08:12,256
who wishes to brutalize
our black leaders,

867
01:08:12,339 --> 01:08:15,676
rape our women,
and destroy our black communities.

868
01:08:18,596 --> 01:08:20,514
Who's the baby killer?

869
01:08:20,639 --> 01:08:23,350
This is my good friend I told you about.
This is Forrest Gump.

870
01:08:23,434 --> 01:08:25,186
Forrest, this is Wesley.

871
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:26,562
Wesley and I lived together in Berkeley,

872
01:08:26,645 --> 01:08:29,273
and he's the president
of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.

873
01:08:29,356 --> 01:08:30,775
Let me tell you something else.

874
01:08:30,858 --> 01:08:35,112
We are here to offer protection and help
for all of those who need our help,

875
01:08:35,196 --> 01:08:38,783
because we, the Black Panthers,
are against the war in Vietnam.

876
01:08:38,866 --> 01:08:42,536
Yes, we are against any war where
black soldiers are sent to the frontline

877
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:44,538
to die for a country that hates them.

878
01:08:44,622 --> 01:08:47,792
Yes, we are against any war
where black soldiers go to fight

879
01:08:47,875 --> 01:08:50,961
and come to be brutalized and killed
in their own communities

880
01:08:51,045 --> 01:08:52,630
as they sleep in their beds at night.

881
01:08:52,713 --> 01:08:53,881
You are a fucking asshole!

882
01:08:53,964 --> 01:08:57,343
Yes, we are against all these racist
and imperial dog acts.

883
01:09:06,644 --> 01:09:09,855
Forrest! Quit it! Quit it!

884
01:09:11,816 --> 01:09:13,067
Forrest!

885
01:09:13,651 --> 01:09:15,402
Stop it! Stop it!

886
01:09:22,034 --> 01:09:23,410
Oh, God...

887
01:09:24,245 --> 01:09:26,664
I shouldn't have brought you here.

888
01:09:26,747 --> 01:09:30,376
I should have known it was just
gonna be some bullshit hassle.

889
01:09:31,544 --> 01:09:34,171
He should not be hitting you, Jenny.

890
01:09:39,093 --> 01:09:40,845
Come on, Forrest.

891
01:09:46,559 --> 01:09:50,563
Sorry I had a fight in the middle
of your Black Panther party.

892
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,776
He doesn't mean it when
he does things like this. He doesn't.

893
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:58,195
I would never hurt you, Jenny.

894
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:02,283
I know you wouldn't, Forrest.

895
01:10:04,201 --> 01:10:06,787
I wanted to be your boyfriend.

896
01:10:17,298 --> 01:10:19,717
That uniform is a trip, Forrest.

897
01:10:21,093 --> 01:10:24,305
You look handsome in it. You do.

898
01:10:28,392 --> 01:10:30,311
- You know what?
- What?

899
01:10:33,939 --> 01:10:37,568
I'm glad we were here together
in our nation's capital.

900
01:10:39,153 --> 01:10:40,905
Me, too, Forrest.

901
01:10:40,988 --> 01:10:45,659
<i>We walked around all night,
Jenny and me, just talking.</i>

902
01:10:47,745 --> 01:10:50,915
<i>She told me about
all the traveling she'd done.</i>

903
01:10:50,998 --> 01:10:55,586
<i>And how she'd discovered ways
to expand her mind</i>

904
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:58,756
<i>and learn how to live in harmony,</i>

905
01:10:58,839 --> 01:11:01,175
<i>which must be out west somewhere,</i>

906
01:11:01,258 --> 01:11:03,594
<i>'cause she made it
all the way to California.</i>

907
01:11:03,677 --> 01:11:05,930
<i>Try to love one another right now</i>

908
01:11:06,013 --> 01:11:07,181
Hey!

909
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:10,684
Anybody want to go to San Francisco?

910
01:11:10,768 --> 01:11:12,645
- I'll go.
- Far out.

911
01:11:14,104 --> 01:11:17,274
<i>It was a very special night
for the two of us.</i>

912
01:11:18,859 --> 01:11:20,945
<i>I didn't want it to end.</i>

913
01:11:21,737 --> 01:11:24,156
I wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.

914
01:11:25,157 --> 01:11:26,951
I have to, Forrest.

915
01:11:27,952 --> 01:11:29,203
Jenny?

916
01:11:31,372 --> 01:11:33,958
Things got a little out of hand.

917
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:37,878
It's just this war
and that lying son of a bitch, Johnson!

918
01:11:39,546 --> 01:11:42,341
I would never hurt you, you know that.

919
01:11:45,469 --> 01:11:47,471
You know what I think?

920
01:11:48,973 --> 01:11:54,228
I think you should go home
to Greenbow, Alabama!

921
01:12:04,738 --> 01:12:09,827
Forrest, we have very different lives,
you know.

922
01:12:19,253 --> 01:12:22,423
I want you to have this.

923
01:12:27,094 --> 01:12:29,263
Forrest, I can't keep this.

924
01:12:30,931 --> 01:12:35,185
I got it just by doing
what you told me to do.

925
01:12:37,229 --> 01:12:39,398
Why are you so good to me?

926
01:12:40,899 --> 01:12:42,443
You're my girl.

927
01:12:44,445 --> 01:12:46,572
I'll always be your girl.

928
01:13:26,987 --> 01:13:31,825
<i>And just like that,
she was gone, out of my life again.</i>

929
01:13:33,327 --> 01:13:35,662
<i>That's one small step for man,</i>

930
01:13:37,664 --> 01:13:40,501
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

931
01:13:46,173 --> 01:13:48,675
<i>I thought I was
going back to Vietnam,</i>

932
01:13:48,801 --> 01:13:52,012
<i>but instead, they decided the best way
for me to fight the Communists</i>

933
01:13:52,096 --> 01:13:53,722
<i>was to play Ping-Pong.</i>

934
01:13:53,806 --> 01:13:56,100
<i>So, I was in the Special Services,</i>

935
01:13:56,183 --> 01:13:59,436
<i>traveling around the country
cheering up all them wounded veterans</i>

936
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,939
and showing them
how to play Ping-Pong.

937
01:14:02,022 --> 01:14:03,941
I was so good that some years later

938
01:14:04,024 --> 01:14:07,653
<i>the Army decided that I should be
on the All-American Ping-Pong team.</i>

939
01:14:08,278 --> 01:14:10,697
<i>We were the first Americans
to visit the land of China</i>

940
01:14:10,781 --> 01:14:13,200
<i>in like a million years,
or something like that.</i>

941
01:14:13,325 --> 01:14:16,745
<i>Somebody said world peace
was in our hands,</i>

942
01:14:16,829 --> 01:14:19,623
<i>but all I did was play Ping-Pong.</i>

943
01:14:19,706 --> 01:14:22,793
When I got home,
I was a national celebrity.

944
01:14:23,502 --> 01:14:25,796
Famouser even than Captain Kangaroo.

945
01:14:25,879 --> 01:14:28,549
<i>Here he is, Forrest Gump, right here.</i>

946
01:14:35,305 --> 01:14:37,057
<i>Mr. Gump, have a seat.</i>

947
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,728
<i>Forrest Gump, John Lennon.</i>

948
01:14:42,396 --> 01:14:43,647
<i>- Welcome home.
- You had quite a trip.</i>

949
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:47,067
<i>Can you tell us, what was China like?</i>

950
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:55,576
<i>In the land of China,
people hardly got nothing at all.</i>

951
01:14:55,659 --> 01:14:57,244
<i>No possessions?</i>

952
01:14:59,872 --> 01:15:03,083
<i>And in China, they never go to church.</i>

953
01:15:04,376 --> 01:15:05,919
<i>No religion, too?</i>

954
01:15:06,003 --> 01:15:07,004
<i>Oh.</i>

955
01:15:08,005 --> 01:15:11,300
<i>- Hard to imagine.
- Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.</i>

956
01:15:13,093 --> 01:15:15,470
<i>Some years later,
that nice young man from England</i>

957
01:15:15,554 --> 01:15:18,182
<i>was on his way home
to see his little boy</i>

958
01:15:18,265 --> 01:15:21,268
<i>and was signing some autographs,</i>

959
01:15:21,393 --> 01:15:25,355
<i>and for no particular reason at all,
somebody shot him.</i>

960
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:32,237
They gave you
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

961
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:35,616
Now, that's Lieutenant Dan.

962
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:40,037
Lieutenant Dan!

963
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:44,583
They gave you
the Congressional Medal of Honor!

964
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:47,961
Yes, sir, they surely did.

965
01:15:48,045 --> 01:15:50,047
They gave you,

966
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:54,301
an imbecile,
a moron who goes on television

967
01:15:54,384 --> 01:15:58,639
and makes a fool out of himself
in front of the whole damn country,

968
01:15:59,306 --> 01:16:01,808
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

969
01:16:02,976 --> 01:16:04,144
Yes, sir.

970
01:16:06,313 --> 01:16:09,149
Well, then, that's just perfect!

971
01:16:11,068 --> 01:16:13,403
Yeah, well,
I just got one thing to say to that.

972
01:16:13,487 --> 01:16:15,739
God damn bless America.

973
01:16:16,657 --> 01:16:17,950
Hey!

974
01:16:19,743 --> 01:16:21,078
Oh, God!

975
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:25,999
- Oh, God!
- Lieutenant Dan!

976
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:29,878
<i>Lieutenant Dan said
he was living in a hotel.</i>

977
01:16:29,962 --> 01:16:31,922
<i>And because he didn't have no legs,</i>

978
01:16:32,005 --> 01:16:35,175
<i>he spent most of his time
exercising his arms.</i>

979
01:16:38,053 --> 01:16:40,514
Take a right. Take a right.

980
01:16:43,141 --> 01:16:45,686
Hey! Come on, already!

981
01:16:45,769 --> 01:16:48,563
What do you do here in New York,
Lieutenant Dan?

982
01:16:48,647 --> 01:16:51,191
I'm living off the government tit.

983
01:16:52,818 --> 01:16:54,194
Sucking it dry!

984
01:16:54,278 --> 01:16:56,321
Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you blind?

985
01:16:56,405 --> 01:16:58,115
- I'm walking here!
- Get out of the way!

986
01:16:58,198 --> 01:17:00,784
Get out! Come on, go! Go! Go!

987
01:17:07,833 --> 01:17:11,586
<i>I stayed with Lieutenant Dan
and celebrated the holidays.</i>

988
01:17:16,008 --> 01:17:19,428
<i>You have a great year.
Hurry home and God bless you.</i>

989
01:17:22,431 --> 01:17:25,225
Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?

990
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:29,479
I didn't know I was supposed to be
looking for him, sir.

991
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:40,449
That's all these cripples,
down at the VA,

992
01:17:40,532 --> 01:17:42,951
that's all they ever talk about.

993
01:17:44,119 --> 01:17:47,080
Jesus this and Jesus that.

994
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:50,834
Have I found Jesus?

995
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:54,463
They even had a priest come
and talk to me.

996
01:17:55,339 --> 01:18:00,010
He said God is listening,
but I have to help myself.

997
01:18:01,386 --> 01:18:03,680
How if I accept Jesus into my heart,

998
01:18:04,681 --> 01:18:08,477
I'll get to walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

999
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,729
Did you hear what I said?

1000
01:18:11,772 --> 01:18:15,776
Walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

1001
01:18:15,859 --> 01:18:18,820
Well, kiss my crippled ass.

1002
01:18:18,904 --> 01:18:22,282
God is listening? What a crock of shit.

1003
01:18:25,952 --> 01:18:28,580
I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.

1004
01:18:30,499 --> 01:18:31,541
Oh?

1005
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:37,756
Well,

1006
01:18:40,717 --> 01:18:44,096
before you go, why don't you get
your ass down to the corner

1007
01:18:44,179 --> 01:18:46,681
- and get us another bottle of Ripple.
- Yes, sir.

1008
01:18:46,765 --> 01:18:51,895
<i>We are at approximately 45th Street
in New York City at One Astor Plaza.</i>

1009
01:18:51,978 --> 01:18:53,814
<i>This is the site of the old Astor Hotel.</i>

1010
01:18:53,897 --> 01:18:56,108
What the hell
is in Bayou La Batre?

1011
01:18:56,191 --> 01:18:58,527
- Shrimping boats.
- Shrimping boats?

1012
01:18:58,610 --> 01:19:01,029
Who gives a shit
about shrimping boats?

1013
01:19:01,113 --> 01:19:02,572
I gotta buy me
one of them shrimping boats,

1014
01:19:02,656 --> 01:19:04,199
soon as I have some money.

1015
01:19:04,282 --> 01:19:07,119
I made me a promise to Bubba
in Vietnam

1016
01:19:07,202 --> 01:19:09,913
that as soon as the war was over,
we'd go in partners.

1017
01:19:09,996 --> 01:19:13,417
He'd be the captain of the
shrimping boat and I'd be his first mate.

1018
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:16,962
But now that he's dead,
that means I gotta be the captain.

1019
01:19:17,045 --> 01:19:19,756
- A shrimp boat captain.
- Yes, sir.

1020
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,300
A promise is a promise, Lieutenant Dan.

1021
01:19:24,094 --> 01:19:26,555
Now hear this!

1022
01:19:27,305 --> 01:19:31,143
Private Gump here
is gonna be a shrimp boat captain.

1023
01:19:31,893 --> 01:19:33,311
Well, I tell you what, Gilligan,

1024
01:19:33,395 --> 01:19:35,856
the day that you are
a shrimp boat captain,

1025
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:39,484
- I will come and be your first mate.
- Okay.

1026
01:19:39,568 --> 01:19:43,905
If you're ever a shrimp boat captain,
that's the day I'm an astronaut.

1027
01:19:43,989 --> 01:19:46,992
Danny, what are you
complaining about?

1028
01:19:47,075 --> 01:19:49,661
- What are you doing, hon?
- Mr. Hot Wheels.

1029
01:19:49,744 --> 01:19:53,373
- Who's your friend?
- My name is Forrest, Forrest Gump.

1030
01:19:54,207 --> 01:19:58,420
This is Cunning Carla
and Long-Limbs Lenore.

1031
01:19:59,504 --> 01:20:02,716
So, where you been, baby cakes, huh?
Haven't seen you around lately.

1032
01:20:02,799 --> 01:20:04,259
You know, you should have
been here for Christmas,

1033
01:20:04,342 --> 01:20:05,677
'cause Tommy bought a round
on the house

1034
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,262
and gave everybody a turkey sandwich.

1035
01:20:07,345 --> 01:20:10,390
Well, well, I had company.

1036
01:20:11,266 --> 01:20:14,936
Hey, hey! We was just there.
That's at Times Square.

1037
01:20:15,562 --> 01:20:19,691
Don't you just love New Year's?
You get to start all over.

1038
01:20:19,774 --> 01:20:23,069
- Hey, Lenore...
- Everybody gets a second chance.

1039
01:20:23,153 --> 01:20:25,697
<i>It's funny,
but in the middle of all that fun,</i>

1040
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:28,074
<i>I began to think about Jenny,</i>

1041
01:20:28,992 --> 01:20:33,455
<i>wondering how she was spending
her New Year's night out in California.</i>

1042
01:20:56,061 --> 01:20:59,564
<i>CROWD:... eight, seven, six, five,</i>

1043
01:20:59,689 --> 01:21:03,151
four, three, two, one!

1044
01:21:03,276 --> 01:21:05,946
Happy New Year!

1045
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:25,131
Happy New Year, Lieutenant Dan!

1046
01:22:00,417 --> 01:22:04,087
What are you, stupid or something?
What's your problem?

1047
01:22:04,754 --> 01:22:06,172
What's his problem?

1048
01:22:06,256 --> 01:22:08,508
Did you lose your pecker in the war
or something?

1049
01:22:08,592 --> 01:22:10,635
What, is your friend stupid
or something?

1050
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:11,803
What did you say?

1051
01:22:11,886 --> 01:22:13,305
I said, is your friend stupid
or something?

1052
01:22:13,388 --> 01:22:15,557
Hey! Don't call him stupid!

1053
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:17,601
- Hey, don't you push her!
- You shut up!

1054
01:22:17,684 --> 01:22:19,728
- Don't you ever call him stupid!
- What's the matter, baby?

1055
01:22:19,811 --> 01:22:21,521
- Why are you so upset?
- Just get the hell out of here.

1056
01:22:21,605 --> 01:22:22,689
- Stupid damn...
- Get your goddamn clothes...

1057
01:22:22,772 --> 01:22:24,274
You belong in <i>Ripley's Believe It Or Not!</i>

1058
01:22:24,357 --> 01:22:26,234
- Get the hell out of here!
- You should be in a sideshow!

1059
01:22:26,318 --> 01:22:27,360
Go on! Get out of here!

1060
01:22:27,444 --> 01:22:28,737
Come on, Lenore.
We don't need this shit!

1061
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:30,196
Get out of here!

1062
01:22:31,823 --> 01:22:34,367
- You retard.
- Loser. You freak.

1063
01:22:39,748 --> 01:22:40,957
No, no.

1064
01:23:06,107 --> 01:23:10,070
I'm sorry I ruined your
New Year's Eve party, Lieutenant Dan.

1065
01:23:10,654 --> 01:23:12,947
She tasted like cigarettes.

1066
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:30,674
<i>I guess Lieutenant Dan figured</i>

1067
01:23:30,757 --> 01:23:33,593
<i>there's some things
you just can't change.</i>

1068
01:23:33,718 --> 01:23:38,848
<i>He didn't want to be called crippled,
just like I didn't want to be called stupid.</i>

1069
01:23:44,354 --> 01:23:46,231
Happy New Year, Gump.

1070
01:23:51,027 --> 01:23:52,404
<i>The US Ping-Pong team</i>

1071
01:23:52,487 --> 01:23:54,781
<i>met with President Nixon today
at an Oval Office ceremony...</i>

1072
01:23:54,864 --> 01:23:57,617
And wouldn't you know it?
A few months later,

1073
01:23:57,701 --> 01:24:01,663
they invited me and the Ping-Pong team
to visit the White House.

1074
01:24:01,746 --> 01:24:03,998
So, I went, again.

1075
01:24:04,833 --> 01:24:08,294
And I met the President
of the United States, again.

1076
01:24:09,045 --> 01:24:12,006
<i>Only, this time, they didn't get us rooms
in a real fancy hotel.</i>

1077
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:15,468
<i>So, are you enjoying yourself
in our nation's capital, young man?</i>

1078
01:24:15,552 --> 01:24:18,555
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Well, where are you staying?</i>

1079
01:24:18,638 --> 01:24:21,266
<i>- It's called the Hotel Ebbott.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.</i>

1080
01:24:21,349 --> 01:24:24,477
<i>I know of a much nicer hotel.
It's brand-new, very modern.</i>

1081
01:24:24,561 --> 01:24:26,563
<i>I'll have my people
take care of it for you.</i>

1082
01:24:27,188 --> 01:24:28,314
<i>Security, Frank Wills.</i>

1083
01:24:28,398 --> 01:24:31,985
Yeah, sir, you might want
to send a maintenance man

1084
01:24:32,068 --> 01:24:34,738
over to that office across the way.

1085
01:24:34,821 --> 01:24:37,699
The lights are off, and they must be
looking for a fuse box or something,

1086
01:24:37,782 --> 01:24:40,493
'cause them flashlights,
they're keeping me awake.

1087
01:24:40,577 --> 01:24:42,203
<i>Okay, sir. I'll check it out.</i>

1088
01:24:42,287 --> 01:24:43,997
- Thank you.
<i>- No problem.</i>

1089
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,999
- Good night.
<i>- Good night.</i>

1090
01:24:49,627 --> 01:24:55,008
<i>Therefore, I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.</i>

1091
01:24:55,091 --> 01:24:57,135
<i>Vice President Ford</i>

1092
01:24:57,218 --> 01:25:01,723
<i>will be sworn in as president
at that hour in this office.</i>

1093
01:25:03,099 --> 01:25:07,896
<i>As I recall the high hopes for America
with which we began this second term...</i>

1094
01:25:13,151 --> 01:25:14,694
Sergeant Gump.

1095
01:25:15,195 --> 01:25:17,405
- Yes, sir!
- As you were.

1096
01:25:17,489 --> 01:25:20,617
I have your discharge papers.
Your service is up, son.

1097
01:25:24,037 --> 01:25:26,790
Does this mean
I can't play Ping-Pong no more?

1098
01:25:26,873 --> 01:25:28,833
For the Army it does.

1099
01:25:31,461 --> 01:25:36,341
<i>And just like that, my service
in the United States Army was over.</i>

1100
01:25:41,638 --> 01:25:43,431
<i>So, I went home.</i>

1101
01:26:04,911 --> 01:26:08,331
- I'm home, Mama.
- I know, I know.

1102
01:26:09,958 --> 01:26:11,501
- Louise, he's here.
<i>- Now, when I got home,</i>

1103
01:26:11,584 --> 01:26:15,630
<i>I had no idea,
but Mama had had all sorts of visitors.</i>

1104
01:26:15,755 --> 01:26:18,049
We've had all sorts of visitors, Forrest.

1105
01:26:18,132 --> 01:26:21,219
Everybody wants you
to use their Ping-Pong stuff.

1106
01:26:21,302 --> 01:26:25,098
One man even left a check for $25,000

1107
01:26:25,181 --> 01:26:28,643
if you'd be agreeable to saying
you liked using their paddle.

1108
01:26:28,768 --> 01:26:31,437
Oh, but, Mama,
I only like using my own paddle.

1109
01:26:31,521 --> 01:26:33,523
- Hi, Miss Louise.
- Hey, Forrest.

1110
01:26:33,606 --> 01:26:36,526
I know that. I know that.

1111
01:26:36,609 --> 01:26:39,279
But it's $25,000, Forrest.

1112
01:26:39,362 --> 01:26:44,033
I thought maybe you could hold it
for a while, see if it grows on you.

1113
01:26:44,117 --> 01:26:46,244
- Oh, you look good, Forrest.
<i>- That Mama, she sure was right.</i>

1114
01:26:46,327 --> 01:26:48,830
- You look real good.
<i>- It's funny how things work out.</i>

1115
01:26:48,955 --> 01:26:52,083
<i>I didn't stay home for long,
because I'd made a promise to Bubba,</i>

1116
01:26:52,166 --> 01:26:54,419
<i>and I always try to keep my promise.</i>

1117
01:26:54,502 --> 01:26:56,045
<i>So, I went on down to Bayou La Batre</i>

1118
01:26:56,129 --> 01:26:59,883
<i>to meet Bubba's family
and make their introduction.</i>

1119
01:26:59,966 --> 01:27:03,636
Are you crazy, or just plain stupid?

1120
01:27:04,345 --> 01:27:06,598
Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.

1121
01:27:06,681 --> 01:27:08,057
I guess.

1122
01:27:09,058 --> 01:27:12,645
<i>And, of course,
I paid my respect to Bubba himself.</i>

1123
01:27:14,647 --> 01:27:17,191
Hey, Bubba, it's me, Forrest Gump.

1124
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:24,365
I remember everything you said,
and I got it all figured out.

1125
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:33,958
I'm taking the $24,562
and 47 cents that I got...

1126
01:27:35,043 --> 01:27:38,630
<i>Or, that's left after a new hair cut
and a new suit,</i>

1127
01:27:38,713 --> 01:27:40,673
<i>and I took Mama out
to a real fancy dinner,</i>

1128
01:27:40,757 --> 01:27:44,010
<i>and I bought a bus ticket
and three Dr. Peppers.</i>

1129
01:27:44,552 --> 01:27:46,346
Tell me something.

1130
01:27:47,388 --> 01:27:49,515
Are you stupid
or something?

1131
01:27:49,599 --> 01:27:51,643
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

1132
01:27:51,726 --> 01:27:54,687
Well, that's what's left after me saying,

1133
01:27:55,605 --> 01:27:57,732
"When I was in China
on the All-America Ping-Pong team,

1134
01:27:57,857 --> 01:28:01,653
"I just loved playing Ping-Pong with
my Flex-O-Light Ping-Pong paddle,"

1135
01:28:01,736 --> 01:28:02,987
which everybody knows isn't true,

1136
01:28:03,071 --> 01:28:04,447
but Mama says it's just a little white lie

1137
01:28:04,530 --> 01:28:06,699
so it wouldn't hurt nobody.

1138
01:28:08,117 --> 01:28:14,040
So, anyway, I'm putting all that on gas,
ropes and new nets

1139
01:28:14,791 --> 01:28:16,542
and a brand-new shrimping boat.

1140
01:28:38,231 --> 01:28:41,484
<i>Now, Bubba had told me everything
he knew about shrimping,</i>

1141
01:28:41,567 --> 01:28:43,903
<i>but you know what I found out?</i>

1142
01:28:45,571 --> 01:28:47,907
<i>Shrimping is tough.</i>

1143
01:28:50,118 --> 01:28:51,953
I only caught five.

1144
01:28:52,078 --> 01:28:53,913
A couple more,
you could have yourself a cocktail.

1145
01:28:58,751 --> 01:29:00,503
Hey, you ever think
about naming this old boat?

1146
01:29:00,586 --> 01:29:03,256
It's bad luck
to have a boat without a name.

1147
01:29:05,633 --> 01:29:10,471
<i>I'd never named a boat before,
but there was only one I could think of,</i>

1148
01:29:11,639 --> 01:29:14,851
<i>the most beautiful name
in the wide world.</i>

1149
01:29:35,872 --> 01:29:38,708
<i>Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny
in a long while,</i>

1150
01:29:38,791 --> 01:29:41,335
<i>but I thought about her a lot,</i>

1151
01:29:41,461 --> 01:29:44,922
<i>and I hoped that whatever
she was doing made her happy.</i>

1152
01:31:31,195 --> 01:31:33,739
<i>I thought about Jenny all the time.</i>

1153
01:31:58,389 --> 01:31:59,557
Hey!

1154
01:32:23,414 --> 01:32:28,085
Lieutenant Dan,
what are you doing here?

1155
01:32:28,169 --> 01:32:32,089
Well, thought I'd try out my sea legs.

1156
01:32:32,173 --> 01:32:35,927
But you ain't got no legs,
Lieutenant Dan.

1157
01:32:36,010 --> 01:32:38,304
Yes, I know that.

1158
01:32:38,638 --> 01:32:40,681
You wrote me a letter, you idiot.

1159
01:32:40,806 --> 01:32:45,353
Well, well. Captain Forrest Gump.
I had to see this for myself.

1160
01:32:46,979 --> 01:32:53,861
And I told you if you were ever
a shrimp boat captain

1161
01:32:53,986 --> 01:32:56,572
that I'd be your first mate.
Well, here I am.

1162
01:32:56,656 --> 01:32:59,784
- I am a man of my word.
- Okay.

1163
01:32:59,867 --> 01:33:03,871
Yeah, but don't you be thinking that
I'm going to be calling you "sir."

1164
01:33:03,996 --> 01:33:05,331
No, sir.

1165
01:33:14,215 --> 01:33:16,509
That's my boat.

1166
01:33:19,095 --> 01:33:24,558
I have a feeling if we head
due east, we'll find some shrimp,

1167
01:33:24,684 --> 01:33:26,269
so take a left.

1168
01:33:27,687 --> 01:33:30,606
- Take a left!
- Which way?

1169
01:33:30,690 --> 01:33:33,359
Over there! They're over there!

1170
01:33:34,026 --> 01:33:37,863
- Get on the wheel and take a left!
- Okay.

1171
01:33:39,073 --> 01:33:43,202
Gump, what are you doing?
Take a left! Left!

1172
01:33:45,579 --> 01:33:49,208
That's where we're going
to find those shrimp, my boy!

1173
01:33:50,793 --> 01:33:52,378
That's where we'll find them.

1174
01:34:05,057 --> 01:34:09,186
- Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.
- Okay, so I was wrong.

1175
01:34:09,895 --> 01:34:13,107
How are we going to find them?

1176
01:34:13,232 --> 01:34:15,735
Well, maybe you should
just pray for shrimp.

1177
01:34:22,366 --> 01:34:25,036
<i>So, I went to church every Sunday.</i>

1178
01:34:26,287 --> 01:34:28,289
<i>Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,</i>

1179
01:34:28,414 --> 01:34:31,417
<i>though I think
he left the praying up to me.</i>

1180
01:34:46,891 --> 01:34:51,270
- No shrimp.
- Where the hell's this God of yours?

1181
01:34:52,104 --> 01:34:57,818
<i>It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that,
'cause right then, God showed up.</i>

1182
01:35:14,668 --> 01:35:19,507
- You'll never sink this boat!
<i>- Now, me, I was scared,</i>

1183
01:35:19,632 --> 01:35:22,676
<i>but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.</i>

1184
01:35:22,802 --> 01:35:24,136
Come on!

1185
01:35:27,264 --> 01:35:32,478
You call this a storm?
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1186
01:35:34,605 --> 01:35:38,984
It's time for a showdown! You and me!

1187
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:42,988
I'm right here! Come and get me!

1188
01:35:44,782 --> 01:35:48,661
You'll never sink this boat!

1189
01:35:50,704 --> 01:35:52,873
<i>Hurricane Carmen
came through here yesterday,</i>

1190
01:35:52,998 --> 01:35:55,543
<i>destroying nearly everything in its path.</i>

1191
01:35:55,668 --> 01:35:58,170
<i>And as in other towns
up and down the coast,</i>

1192
01:35:58,337 --> 01:36:00,714
<i>Bayou La Batre's
entire shrimping industry</i>

1193
01:36:00,798 --> 01:36:04,677
<i>has fallen victim to Carmen
and has been left in utter ruin.</i>

1194
01:36:04,802 --> 01:36:07,930
<i>Speaking with local officials,
this reporter has learned,</i>

1195
01:36:08,013 --> 01:36:11,475
<i>in fact, only one shrimping boat
actually survived the storm.</i>

1196
01:36:11,851 --> 01:36:14,478
Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.

1197
01:36:15,187 --> 01:36:17,189
<i>After that,
shrimping was easy.</i>

1198
01:36:22,862 --> 01:36:25,990
<i>Since people still needed
them shrimps for shrimp cocktails</i>

1199
01:36:26,073 --> 01:36:30,202
and barbecues and all,
and we were the only boat left standing,

1200
01:36:30,369 --> 01:36:33,622
Bubba-Gump Shrimp's what they got.

1201
01:36:33,706 --> 01:36:38,294
We got a whole bunch of boats,
12 <i>Jennys,</i>

1202
01:36:38,377 --> 01:36:41,881
a big old warehouse. We even have
hats that say "Bubba-Gump" on them.

1203
01:36:42,214 --> 01:36:45,509
Bubba-Gump Shrimp.
It's a household name.

1204
01:36:45,718 --> 01:36:47,428
Hold on there, boy.

1205
01:36:47,553 --> 01:36:52,099
Are you telling me you're the owner of
the Bubba-Gump Shrimp Corporation?

1206
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:55,227
Yes, sir. We got more money
than Davy Crockett.

1207
01:36:56,854 --> 01:37:00,900
Boy, I heard some whoppers in my time,
but that tops them all.

1208
01:37:03,611 --> 01:37:06,405
We was sitting next to a millionaire.

1209
01:37:09,909 --> 01:37:14,538
Well, I thought it was a very lovely story,

1210
01:37:14,955 --> 01:37:19,585
and you tell it so well,
with such enthusiasm.

1211
01:37:21,295 --> 01:37:23,964
Would you like to see
what Lieutenant Dan looks like?

1212
01:37:24,089 --> 01:37:25,591
Well, yes, I would.

1213
01:37:30,596 --> 01:37:32,640
That's him right there.

1214
01:37:34,975 --> 01:37:37,228
And let me tell you something
about Lieutenant Dan...

1215
01:37:38,395 --> 01:37:39,438
Forrest,

1216
01:37:44,985 --> 01:37:47,780
I never thanked you for saving my life.

1217
01:38:13,806 --> 01:38:20,104
<i>He never actually said so,
but I think he made his peace with God.</i>

1218
01:38:27,778 --> 01:38:29,989
<i>For the second time in 17 days,</i>

1219
01:38:30,114 --> 01:38:33,576
<i>President Ford escaped
possible assassination today.</i>

1220
01:38:33,659 --> 01:38:34,952
<i>Base to</i> Jenny 1.

1221
01:38:35,035 --> 01:38:38,539
<i>- Base to</i> Jenny 1.
<i>- Jenny 1</i>. Go, Margo.

1222
01:38:38,622 --> 01:38:40,124
<i>Forrest has a phone call.</i>

1223
01:38:40,207 --> 01:38:42,710
Yeah, well, you'll have to tell them
to call him back.

1224
01:38:42,793 --> 01:38:46,171
- He is indisposed at the moment.
<i>- His mama's sick.</i>

1225
01:39:06,859 --> 01:39:09,236
- Where's Mama?
- She's upstairs.

1226
01:39:12,072 --> 01:39:14,033
Hi, Forrest.

1227
01:39:14,992 --> 01:39:17,536
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

1228
01:39:24,209 --> 01:39:27,379
We sure got you straightened out,
didn't we, boy?

1229
01:39:38,724 --> 01:39:42,686
- What's the matter, Mama?
- I'm dying, Forrest.

1230
01:39:46,023 --> 01:39:48,400
Come on in, sit down over here.

1231
01:40:02,748 --> 01:40:06,251
- Why are you dying, Mama?
- It's my time.

1232
01:40:07,252 --> 01:40:09,129
It's just my time.

1233
01:40:10,589 --> 01:40:14,760
Now, don't you be afraid, sweetheart.

1234
01:40:16,387 --> 01:40:18,764
Death is just a part of life,

1235
01:40:19,765 --> 01:40:22,393
something we're all destined to do.

1236
01:40:24,228 --> 01:40:28,607
I didn't know it,
but I was destined to be your mama.

1237
01:40:29,441 --> 01:40:33,028
- I did the best I could.
- You did good, Mama.

1238
01:40:33,821 --> 01:40:38,992
Well, I happen to believe
you make your own destiny.

1239
01:40:40,494 --> 01:40:43,747
You have to do the best
with what God gave you.

1240
01:40:47,626 --> 01:40:49,753
What's my destiny, Mama?

1241
01:40:51,922 --> 01:40:55,134
You're going to have
to figure that out for yourself.

1242
01:40:56,427 --> 01:40:59,388
Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest.

1243
01:40:59,471 --> 01:41:01,640
You never know
what you're going to get.

1244
01:41:01,765 --> 01:41:06,145
<i>Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.</i>

1245
01:41:06,228 --> 01:41:08,439
I will miss you, Forrest.

1246
01:41:10,274 --> 01:41:14,319
<i>She had got the cancer
and died on a Tuesday.</i>

1247
01:41:15,821 --> 01:41:19,158
<i>I bought her a new hat
with little flowers on it.</i>

1248
01:41:22,202 --> 01:41:25,497
And that's all I have to say about that.

1249
01:41:32,337 --> 01:41:34,631
Didn't you say you were waiting
for the number seven bus?

1250
01:41:34,715 --> 01:41:37,509
There'll be another one along shortly.

1251
01:41:41,346 --> 01:41:44,933
Now, because I had been a football star,
and a war hero,

1252
01:41:45,017 --> 01:41:48,145
and a national celebrity,
and a shrimping boat captain,

1253
01:41:48,645 --> 01:41:51,857
and a college graduate,
the city fathers of Greenbow, Alabama

1254
01:41:51,982 --> 01:41:55,194
decided to get together
and offered me a fine job.

1255
01:41:56,570 --> 01:42:00,240
<i>So, I never went back to work
for Lieutenant Dan,</i>

1256
01:42:00,365 --> 01:42:03,076
<i>though he did take care
of my Bubba-Gump money.</i>

1257
01:42:03,202 --> 01:42:07,790
<i>He got me invested
in some kind of fruit company.</i>

1258
01:42:07,873 --> 01:42:09,458
<i>And so then, I got a call from him saying</i>

1259
01:42:09,541 --> 01:42:13,003
we don't have to worry about money
no more, and I said,

1260
01:42:13,086 --> 01:42:15,380
"That's good. One less thing."

1261
01:42:18,425 --> 01:42:22,346
<i>Now, Mama said there's only
so much fortune a man really needs,</i>

1262
01:42:23,096 --> 01:42:25,933
<i>and the rest is just for showing off.</i>

1263
01:42:26,016 --> 01:42:29,895
<i>So, I gave a whole bunch of it
to the Foursquare gospel church,</i>

1264
01:42:32,356 --> 01:42:36,527
<i>and I gave a whole bunch to the
Bayou La Batre fishing hospital.</i>

1265
01:42:39,404 --> 01:42:43,951
<i>And even though Bubba was dead
and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,</i>

1266
01:42:44,076 --> 01:42:46,703
<i>I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.</i>

1267
01:42:50,916 --> 01:42:52,626
You know what?

1268
01:42:53,877 --> 01:42:56,880
<i>She didn't have to work
in nobody's kitchen no more.</i>

1269
01:42:56,964 --> 01:42:58,590
That smells wonderful.

1270
01:42:59,424 --> 01:43:03,345
<i>And 'cause I was a gazillionaire
and I liked doing it so much,</i>

1271
01:43:03,428 --> 01:43:05,764
<i>I cut that grass for free.</i>

1272
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:12,437
<i>But at night time
when there was nothing to do</i>

1273
01:43:12,521 --> 01:43:14,898
<i>and the house was all empty,</i>

1274
01:43:15,899 --> 01:43:18,277
<i>I'd always think of Jenny.</i>

1275
01:44:21,965 --> 01:44:25,135
<i>And then, she was there.</i>

1276
01:44:58,126 --> 01:45:01,296
- Hello, Forrest.
- Hello, Jenny.

1277
01:45:12,849 --> 01:45:15,477
<i>Jenny came back and stayed with me.</i>

1278
01:45:17,062 --> 01:45:20,732
<i>Maybe it was because
she had nowhere else to go,</i>

1279
01:45:20,857 --> 01:45:24,569
<i>or maybe it was because she was
so tired, 'cause she went to bed</i>

1280
01:45:24,695 --> 01:45:28,657
<i>and slept and slept,
like she hadn't slept in years.</i>

1281
01:45:29,908 --> 01:45:32,202
<i>It was wonderful having her home.</i>

1282
01:45:33,537 --> 01:45:38,667
<i>Every day we'd take a walk and
I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree,</i>

1283
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:41,294
<i>and she'd listen about Ping-Ponging,
and shrimping,</i>

1284
01:45:41,378 --> 01:45:45,674
<i>and Mama making a trip up to heaven.
I did all the talking.</i>

1285
01:45:45,757 --> 01:45:49,094
<i>Jenny most of the time was real quiet.</i>

1286
01:46:29,259 --> 01:46:32,471
How could you do this?

1287
01:47:09,424 --> 01:47:12,761
<i>Sometimes I guess there
just aren't enough rocks.</i>

1288
01:47:14,971 --> 01:47:19,476
<i>I never really knew why she came back,
but I didn't care.</i>

1289
01:47:19,643 --> 01:47:23,939
<i>It was like olden times.
We was like peas and carrots again.</i>

1290
01:47:26,024 --> 01:47:30,362
<i>Every day, I'd pick pretty flowers
and put them in her room for her,</i>

1291
01:47:31,863 --> 01:47:35,450
<i>and she gave me the best gift anyone
could ever get in the wide world.</i>

1292
01:47:35,534 --> 01:47:38,370
- New shoes.
- They make them just for running.

1293
01:47:43,375 --> 01:47:46,670
<i>And she even showed me how to dance.</i>

1294
01:47:54,845 --> 01:47:59,057
<i>And, well, we was like family,
Jenny and me.</i>

1295
01:48:02,811 --> 01:48:05,730
<i>And it was the happiest time in my life.</i>

1296
01:48:25,375 --> 01:48:27,169
<i>MAN ON TV:... and this Fourth is
witnessing one of the</i>

1297
01:48:27,252 --> 01:48:30,255
<i>largest fireworks displays
in the nation's...</i>

1298
01:48:30,338 --> 01:48:33,258
- You done watching it?
<i>- ...here in New York Harbor...</i>

1299
01:48:33,383 --> 01:48:35,177
- I'm going to bed.
<i>- ...with a spectacular display</i>

1300
01:48:35,260 --> 01:48:38,305
<i>Of tall ships earlier.
The Statue of Liberty...</i>

1301
01:48:45,353 --> 01:48:47,355
Will you marry me?

1302
01:48:52,277 --> 01:48:55,238
I'd make a good husband, Jenny.

1303
01:48:57,908 --> 01:48:59,951
You would, Forrest.

1304
01:49:01,786 --> 01:49:04,122
But you won't marry me.

1305
01:49:06,416 --> 01:49:08,627
You don't want to marry me.

1306
01:49:12,214 --> 01:49:14,633
Why don't you love me, Jenny?

1307
01:49:19,638 --> 01:49:21,765
I'm not a smart man,

1308
01:49:23,475 --> 01:49:25,894
but I know what love is.

1309
01:50:02,931 --> 01:50:04,182
Jenny.

1310
01:50:06,101 --> 01:50:08,603
Forrest, I do love you.

1311
01:51:01,740 --> 01:51:05,410
- Where are you running off to?
- I'm not running.

1312
01:52:37,001 --> 01:52:42,340
<i>That day, for no particular reason,
I decided to go for a little run.</i>

1313
01:52:43,508 --> 01:52:47,929
<i>So, I ran to the end of the road,
and when I got there,</i>

1314
01:52:48,012 --> 01:52:49,764
<i>I thought maybe I'd run
to the end of town.</i>

1315
01:52:49,848 --> 01:52:51,015
<i>President Carter, suffering</i>

1316
01:52:51,099 --> 01:52:53,101
<i>from heat exhaustion,
fell into the arms of...</i>

1317
01:52:53,184 --> 01:52:54,853
<i>And when I got there,</i>

1318
01:52:54,936 --> 01:52:59,107
<i>I thought maybe I'd just
run across Greenbow County.</i>

1319
01:52:59,190 --> 01:53:01,609
<i>And I figured since I'd run this far,</i>

1320
01:53:01,693 --> 01:53:04,946
<i>maybe I'd just run across
the great state of Alabama.</i>

1321
01:53:05,029 --> 01:53:06,239
<i>And that's what I did.</i>

1322
01:53:06,865 --> 01:53:09,451
I ran clear across Alabama.

1323
01:53:09,701 --> 01:53:12,871
For no particular reason,
I just kept on going.

1324
01:53:14,205 --> 01:53:15,790
I ran clear to the ocean.

1325
01:53:21,671 --> 01:53:24,841
<i>And when I got there,
I figured since I'd gone this far,</i>

1326
01:53:25,383 --> 01:53:28,219
<i>might as well turn around
and just keep on going.</i>

1327
01:53:31,973 --> 01:53:36,561
<i>And when I got to another ocean,
I figured since I'd gone this far,</i>

1328
01:53:38,354 --> 01:53:42,066
<i>I might as well just turn back
and keep right on going.</i>

1329
01:53:43,234 --> 01:53:48,072
<i>When I got tired, I slept.
When I got hungry, I ate.</i>

1330
01:53:48,156 --> 01:53:51,201
When I had to go, you know...

1331
01:53:52,827 --> 01:53:53,995
I went.

1332
01:53:54,078 --> 01:53:57,081
And so, you just ran.

1333
01:53:58,833 --> 01:53:59,918
Yeah.

1334
01:54:35,203 --> 01:54:40,458
<i>I'd think a lot about Mama
and Bubba and Lieutenant Dan.</i>

1335
01:54:41,459 --> 01:54:44,963
<i>But most of all, I thought about Jenny.</i>

1336
01:54:46,047 --> 01:54:48,216
<i>I thought about her a lot.</i>

1337
01:54:48,967 --> 01:54:52,053
<i>For more than two years now,
a man named Forrest Gump,</i>

1338
01:54:52,136 --> 01:54:55,557
<i>a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,
stopping only to sleep,</i>

1339
01:54:55,640 --> 01:54:57,809
<i>has been running across America.</i>

1340
01:54:57,892 --> 01:54:59,894
<i>Charles Cooper brings us this report.</i>

1341
01:55:00,812 --> 01:55:03,231
<i>For the fourth time
on his journey across America,</i>

1342
01:55:03,314 --> 01:55:06,150
<i>Forrest Gump,
the gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,</i>

1343
01:55:06,276 --> 01:55:09,153
<i>is about to cross
the Mississippi River again today.</i>

1344
01:55:09,779 --> 01:55:11,823
- I'll be damned. Forrest?
<i>- Sir, why are you running?</i>

1345
01:55:11,906 --> 01:55:12,991
Why are you running?

1346
01:55:13,074 --> 01:55:14,659
Are you doing this for world peace?

1347
01:55:14,742 --> 01:55:16,077
Are you doing this for the homeless?

1348
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:19,163
- Are you running for women's rights?
- Or for the environment?

1349
01:55:19,247 --> 01:55:20,248
Or for animals?

1350
01:55:20,331 --> 01:55:23,251
<i>They just couldn't believe
that somebody would do all that running</i>

1351
01:55:23,334 --> 01:55:24,711
<i>for no particular reason.</i>

1352
01:55:24,794 --> 01:55:26,754
Why are you doing this?

1353
01:55:26,838 --> 01:55:29,340
I just felt like running.

1354
01:55:29,465 --> 01:55:31,843
I just felt like running.

1355
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:35,179
It's you. I can't believe it's really you.

1356
01:55:36,014 --> 01:55:41,144
Now, for some reason, what I was doing
seemed to make sense to people.

1357
01:55:41,311 --> 01:55:43,438
I mean, it was like an alarm
went off in my head, you know?

1358
01:55:43,521 --> 01:55:45,356
I said,
"Here's a guy that's got his act together.

1359
01:55:45,481 --> 01:55:47,442
"Here's somebody
who's got it all figured out.

1360
01:55:47,525 --> 01:55:51,613
"Here's somebody who has the answer."
I'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump.

1361
01:55:51,696 --> 01:55:53,531
<i>So, I got company.</i>

1362
01:55:55,366 --> 01:56:01,205
<i>And after that, I got more company.
And then, even more people joined in.</i>

1363
01:56:03,666 --> 01:56:06,878
Somebody later told me
it gave people hope.

1364
01:56:08,671 --> 01:56:12,050
Now... Now, I don't know
anything about that,

1365
01:56:12,884 --> 01:56:15,470
<i>but some of those people
asked me if I could help them out.</i>

1366
01:56:15,678 --> 01:56:18,931
Hey, man, hey, listen, I was wondering
if you might help me, huh?

1367
01:56:19,015 --> 01:56:20,767
Listen, I'm in the
bumper sticker business

1368
01:56:20,850 --> 01:56:22,602
and I've been trying
to think up a good slogan.

1369
01:56:22,685 --> 01:56:25,813
And since you have been such a big
inspiration to the people around here,

1370
01:56:25,897 --> 01:56:27,815
I thought you might
be able to help me jump into...

1371
01:56:27,899 --> 01:56:31,527
Whoa, man! You just ran through
a big pile of dog shit!

1372
01:56:33,071 --> 01:56:35,740
- It happens.
- What, shit?

1373
01:56:37,241 --> 01:56:39,202
Sometimes.

1374
01:56:41,079 --> 01:56:43,748
<i>And some years later,
I heard that that fellow</i>

1375
01:56:43,831 --> 01:56:45,667
<i>did come up with
a bumper sticker slogan,</i>

1376
01:56:45,750 --> 01:56:48,753
<i>and he made a lot of money off of it.</i>

1377
01:56:50,213 --> 01:56:52,423
<i>Another time, I was running along,</i>

1378
01:56:52,548 --> 01:56:55,843
<i>somebody who had lost all his money
in the T-shirt business,</i>

1379
01:56:55,927 --> 01:56:57,970
<i>he wanted to put my face on a T-shirt,</i>

1380
01:56:58,054 --> 01:57:01,015
<i>but he couldn't draw that well,
and he didn't have a camera.</i>

1381
01:57:01,099 --> 01:57:04,602
Here, use this one.
Nobody likes that color anyway.

1382
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:11,109
Have a nice day.

1383
01:57:12,735 --> 01:57:13,861
<i>Well, some years later,</i>

1384
01:57:13,945 --> 01:57:17,865
<i>I found out that that man
did come up with an idea for a T-shirt.</i>

1385
01:57:17,949 --> 01:57:20,326
<i>He made a lot of money off of it.</i>

1386
01:57:23,121 --> 01:57:27,542
<i>Anyway, like I was saying,
I had a lot of company.</i>

1387
01:57:28,793 --> 01:57:29,961
<i>My mama always said,</i>

1388
01:57:30,044 --> 01:57:34,465
<i>"You got to put the past behind you
before you can move on."</i>

1389
01:57:36,134 --> 01:57:39,470
<i>And I think that's what
my running was all about.</i>

1390
01:57:40,304 --> 01:57:44,308
<i>I had run for three years, two months,</i>

1391
01:57:44,559 --> 01:57:46,894
<i>14 days and 16 hours.</i>

1392
01:58:02,577 --> 01:58:04,912
Quiet. Quiet.
He's going to say something.

1393
01:58:16,340 --> 01:58:18,092
I'm pretty tired.

1394
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:22,972
Think I'll go home now.

1395
01:58:41,532 --> 01:58:43,993
Now what are we supposed to do?

1396
01:58:44,952 --> 01:58:49,207
<i>And just like that,
my running days was over.</i>

1397
01:58:51,167 --> 01:58:52,919
<i>So, I went home to Alabama.</i>

1398
01:58:53,711 --> 01:58:57,590
<i>Moments ago, at 2:25 p.m.,
as President Reagan was leaving the...</i>

1399
01:58:59,634 --> 01:59:03,805
<i>...five or six gunshots were fired
by an unknown would-be assassin.</i>

1400
01:59:04,305 --> 01:59:06,641
<i>The President was shot in the chest,
and the assailant...</i>

1401
01:59:06,724 --> 01:59:08,684
I picked up the mail.

1402
01:59:09,477 --> 01:59:13,314
And one day, out of the blue clear sky,
I got a letter from Jenny,

1403
01:59:13,397 --> 01:59:17,652
wondering if I could come down
to Savannah and see her,

1404
01:59:17,735 --> 01:59:20,321
and that's what I'm doing here.

1405
01:59:20,404 --> 01:59:22,990
She saw me on TV, running.

1406
01:59:23,074 --> 01:59:27,328
I'm supposed to go on the
number nine bus to Richmond Street

1407
01:59:27,411 --> 01:59:34,335
and get off and go one block left
to 1947 Henry Street, Apartment 4.

1408
01:59:34,418 --> 01:59:38,089
Why, you don't need to take a bus.

1409
01:59:38,214 --> 01:59:42,760
Henry Street is just five
or six blocks down that way.

1410
01:59:44,595 --> 01:59:46,931
- Down that way?
- Down that way.

1411
01:59:49,934 --> 01:59:51,853
It was nice talking to you.

1412
01:59:53,145 --> 01:59:55,773
I hope everything works out for you!

1413
02:00:03,281 --> 02:00:04,949
Hey!

1414
02:00:05,366 --> 02:00:07,034
Forrest!

1415
02:00:07,285 --> 02:00:10,538
How you doing? Come in, come in!

1416
02:00:10,621 --> 02:00:11,831
I got your letter.

1417
02:00:11,914 --> 02:00:14,542
I was wondering about that.

1418
02:00:16,085 --> 02:00:17,879
Is this your house?

1419
02:00:17,962 --> 02:00:21,048
Yeah. It's messy right now.
I just got off work.

1420
02:00:21,132 --> 02:00:24,844
It's nice. You got air conditioning.

1421
02:00:31,726 --> 02:00:33,769
- Thank you.
- I ate some.

1422
02:00:36,564 --> 02:00:41,986
Hey, I kept a scrapbook
of your clippings and everything.

1423
02:00:42,111 --> 02:00:43,738
There you are.

1424
02:00:45,323 --> 02:00:46,699
And this, I got you running.

1425
02:00:49,660 --> 02:00:51,829
I ran a long way,

1426
02:00:52,330 --> 02:00:54,165
for a long time.

1427
02:00:56,375 --> 02:00:57,877
And there...

1428
02:01:04,383 --> 02:01:07,845
Listen, Forrest,
I don't know how to say this.

1429
02:01:10,348 --> 02:01:14,685
I just I want to apologize
for anything that I ever did to you,

1430
02:01:14,810 --> 02:01:20,066
'cause I was messed up
for a long time, and...

1431
02:01:21,734 --> 02:01:22,735
Yoo-hoo!

1432
02:01:22,860 --> 02:01:24,487
- Hey.
- Hi.

1433
02:01:24,695 --> 02:01:25,696
Hey, you.

1434
02:01:26,864 --> 02:01:29,825
- This is an old friend from Alabama.
- How do you do?

1435
02:01:29,909 --> 02:01:32,995
Listen, next week my schedule
changes, so I'll be able to... But thanks...

1436
02:01:33,079 --> 02:01:35,122
No problem. Got to go, Jen,
I'm double-parked.

1437
02:01:35,206 --> 02:01:37,083
- Okay. Thanks.
- Bye.

1438
02:01:40,544 --> 02:01:43,297
This is my very good friend, Mr. Gump.
Can you say hi to him?

1439
02:01:43,381 --> 02:01:46,467
- Hello, Mr. Gump.
- Hello.

1440
02:01:46,550 --> 02:01:49,553
- Can I go watch TV now?
- Yes, you can. Just keep it low.

1441
02:01:52,390 --> 02:01:55,726
- You're a mama, Jenny.
- I'm a mama.

1442
02:01:58,604 --> 02:02:00,439
His name's Forrest.

1443
02:02:01,565 --> 02:02:02,900
Like me.

1444
02:02:04,527 --> 02:02:06,654
I named him after his daddy.

1445
02:02:07,613 --> 02:02:10,074
He got a daddy named Forrest, too?

1446
02:02:11,367 --> 02:02:13,411
You're his daddy, Forrest.

1447
02:02:27,883 --> 02:02:29,093
Hey.

1448
02:02:30,261 --> 02:02:33,139
Forrest, look at me. Look at me, Forrest.

1449
02:02:35,725 --> 02:02:39,854
There's nothing you need to do, okay?
You didn't do anything wrong.

1450
02:02:40,396 --> 02:02:41,772
Okay?

1451
02:02:46,110 --> 02:02:47,987
Isn't he beautiful?

1452
02:02:48,988 --> 02:02:51,949
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1453
02:02:55,745 --> 02:02:56,829
But...

1454
02:03:00,499 --> 02:03:03,377
Is he smart, or...

1455
02:03:03,461 --> 02:03:07,465
He's very smart.
He's one of the smartest in his class.

1456
02:03:16,807 --> 02:03:19,268
Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him.

1457
02:03:28,611 --> 02:03:31,447
- What are you watching?
- Bert and Ernie.

1458
02:03:54,553 --> 02:03:56,347
Forrest,

1459
02:03:57,807 --> 02:03:59,350
I'm sick.

1460
02:04:02,019 --> 02:04:05,648
What, do you have
a cough due to a cold?

1461
02:04:05,731 --> 02:04:08,109
I have some kind of virus,

1462
02:04:08,192 --> 02:04:10,903
and the doctors don't...
They don't know what it is,

1463
02:04:11,028 --> 02:04:14,031
and there isn't anything
they can do about it.

1464
02:04:18,410 --> 02:04:20,704
You could come home with me.

1465
02:04:22,373 --> 02:04:28,045
Jenny, you and little Forrest could
come stay at my house in Greenbow.

1466
02:04:32,383 --> 02:04:35,177
I'll take care of you if you're sick.

1467
02:04:37,555 --> 02:04:39,849
Would you marry me, Forrest?

1468
02:04:45,104 --> 02:04:46,355
Okay.

1469
02:04:47,398 --> 02:04:49,066
Please take your seats.

1470
02:04:52,903 --> 02:04:55,239
Forrest? It's time to start.

1471
02:05:14,633 --> 02:05:16,218
Hi.

1472
02:05:17,094 --> 02:05:18,596
Your tie.

1473
02:05:31,150 --> 02:05:32,776
Lieutenant Dan.

1474
02:05:48,125 --> 02:05:50,085
Lieutenant Dan.

1475
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:52,588
Hello, Forrest.

1476
02:05:53,255 --> 02:05:55,925
You got new legs. New legs!

1477
02:05:57,134 --> 02:06:00,930
Yeah. I got new legs. Custom-made.

1478
02:06:01,639 --> 02:06:05,643
Titanium alloy.
It's what they use on the space shuttle.

1479
02:06:09,480 --> 02:06:10,981
Magic legs.

1480
02:06:12,983 --> 02:06:17,363
This is my fiancée, Susan.

1481
02:06:20,157 --> 02:06:23,535
- Lieutenant Dan.
- Hi, Forrest.

1482
02:06:25,621 --> 02:06:28,832
Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.

1483
02:06:29,208 --> 02:06:32,211
Hey. It's nice to meet you finally.

1484
02:06:42,346 --> 02:06:46,517
Do you, Forrest,
take Jenny to be your wife?

1485
02:06:48,394 --> 02:06:52,648
Do you, Jenny,
take Forrest to be your husband?

1486
02:06:53,983 --> 02:06:57,361
And so I pronounce you man and wife.

1487
02:07:28,225 --> 02:07:30,102
- Hey.
- Hey.

1488
02:07:43,782 --> 02:07:45,576
Hey, Forrest.

1489
02:07:50,914 --> 02:07:52,708
Were you scared in Vietnam?

1490
02:07:54,376 --> 02:07:56,712
Yes. Well, I...

1491
02:07:58,047 --> 02:07:59,757
I don't know.

1492
02:08:00,466 --> 02:08:05,429
<i>Sometimes it would stop raining long
enough for the stars to come out.</i>

1493
02:08:08,557 --> 02:08:10,601
<i>And then it was nice.</i>

1494
02:08:13,979 --> 02:08:17,941
It was like just before the sun
goes to bed down on the bayou.

1495
02:08:19,234 --> 02:08:23,113
<i>There was always
a million sparkles on the water.</i>

1496
02:08:24,907 --> 02:08:28,827
<i>Like that mountain lake.
It was so clear, Jenny,</i>

1497
02:08:28,952 --> 02:08:33,540
<i>it looked like there were two skies,
one on top of the other.</i>

1498
02:08:36,085 --> 02:08:39,129
And then, in the desert,
when the sun comes up,

1499
02:08:41,590 --> 02:08:45,761
<i>I couldn't tell where heaven stopped</i>

1500
02:08:46,303 --> 02:08:48,680
<i>and the earth began.</i>

1501
02:08:49,932 --> 02:08:51,809
<i>It was so beautiful.</i>

1502
02:08:56,522 --> 02:08:59,608
I wish I could've been there with you.

1503
02:09:02,694 --> 02:09:04,113
You were.

1504
02:09:14,832 --> 02:09:16,291
I love you.

1505
02:09:20,671 --> 02:09:24,007
<i>You died on a Saturday morning.</i>

1506
02:09:25,717 --> 02:09:29,471
And I had you placed
here under our tree.

1507
02:09:34,351 --> 02:09:39,189
And I had that house of your father's
bulldozed to the ground.

1508
02:09:43,318 --> 02:09:44,987
<i>Mama</i>

1509
02:09:46,071 --> 02:09:51,076
always said that dying was a part of life.

1510
02:09:54,496 --> 02:09:56,832
I sure wish it wasn't.

1511
02:09:59,501 --> 02:10:03,255
Little Forrest is doing just fine.

1512
02:10:04,590 --> 02:10:05,674
But...

1513
02:10:05,924 --> 02:10:08,594
<i>About to start school again soon,</i>

1514
02:10:10,429 --> 02:10:14,224
and I make his breakfast, lunch
and dinner every day.

1515
02:10:16,393 --> 02:10:22,399
I make sure he combs his hair
and brushes his teeth every day.

1516
02:10:25,527 --> 02:10:28,113
Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.

1517
02:10:29,406 --> 02:10:30,449
Okay.

1518
02:10:30,699 --> 02:10:31,867
<i>He's really good.</i>

1519
02:10:31,950 --> 02:10:34,077
Forrest, you go.

1520
02:10:38,290 --> 02:10:39,875
<i>We fish a lot.</i>

1521
02:10:43,420 --> 02:10:46,882
And every night, we read
a book. He's so smart, Jenny.

1522
02:10:50,135 --> 02:10:52,387
You'd be so proud of him.

1523
02:10:54,097 --> 02:10:55,557
I am.

1524
02:10:56,600 --> 02:10:59,811
He wrote you a letter.

1525
02:11:01,396 --> 02:11:03,440
And he says I can't read it.

1526
02:11:03,565 --> 02:11:07,110
I'm not supposed to,
so I'll just leave it here for you.

1527
02:11:23,168 --> 02:11:24,503
Jenny,

1528
02:11:30,300 --> 02:11:33,512
I don't know if Mama was right,

1529
02:11:34,846 --> 02:11:36,348
or if it's Lieutenant Dan.

1530
02:11:36,473 --> 02:11:39,059
I don't know

1531
02:11:39,142 --> 02:11:43,647
if we each have a destiny,

1532
02:11:45,691 --> 02:11:50,821
or if we're all just floating around
accidental-like on a breeze.

1533
02:11:55,325 --> 02:11:57,160
But I think

1534
02:11:59,037 --> 02:12:00,831
maybe it's both.

1535
02:12:05,168 --> 02:12:08,046
Maybe both is happening
at the same time.

1536
02:12:14,177 --> 02:12:16,179
But I miss you, Jenny.

1537
02:12:22,561 --> 02:12:26,982
If there's anything you need,
I won't be far away.

1538
02:13:02,267 --> 02:13:05,228
Here's your bus. Okay.

1539
02:13:06,897 --> 02:13:10,233
Hey. I know this.

1540
02:13:10,359 --> 02:13:13,236
I'm gonna show that
for show-and-tell because

1541
02:13:13,362 --> 02:13:16,031
Grandma used to read it to you.

1542
02:13:16,114 --> 02:13:18,241
My favorite book.

1543
02:13:21,578 --> 02:13:23,080
Here we are.

1544
02:13:23,246 --> 02:13:24,706
Okay.

1545
02:13:26,416 --> 02:13:27,918
Here you go.

1546
02:13:32,798 --> 02:13:35,300
Hey, Forrest, don't...

1547
02:13:38,762 --> 02:13:42,474
- I wanted to tell you, I love you.
- I love you, too, Daddy.

1548
02:13:44,476 --> 02:13:47,270
I'll be right here when you get back.

1549
02:13:51,817 --> 02:13:55,070
You understand this is
the bus to school, now, don't you?

1550
02:13:55,153 --> 02:13:58,699
Of course, and you are Dorothy Harris,
and I'm Forrest Gump.
